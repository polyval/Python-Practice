dot_NET
A Microsoft operating system platform that incorporates applications, a suite of tools and services and a change in the infrastructure of the company's Web strategy. The .NET Framework supports building and running of next gen of applications and XML Web services.
There are four main principles of .NET from the perspective of the user:

It erases the boundaries between applications and the Internet. Instead of interacting with an application or a single Web site, .NET will connect the user to an array of computers and services that will exchange and combine objects and data.
Software will be rented as a hosted service over the Internet instead of purchased on a store shelf. Essentially, the Internet will be housing all your applications and data.
Users will have access to their information on the Internet from any device, anytime, anywhere.
There will be new ways to interact with application data, such as speech and handwriting recognition.

.NET depends on four Internet standards:

dot_NET_Framework
A programming infrastructure created by Microsoft for building, deploying, and running applications and services that use .NET technologies, such as desktop applications and Web services.
The .NET Framework contains three major parts:

the Common Language Runtime
the Framework Class Library
ASP.NET.


D_channel
Short for Delta-channel, the channel in an ISDN connection that carries control and signaling information. Basic Rate ISDN (BRI) service consists of two 64 Kbps B-channels, and one D-channel for transmitting control information. Primary ISDN service consists of 23 B-channels (in the U.S.) or 30 B-channels (in Europe).  Compare with B-channel.

D_ILA
Short for Direct Drive Image Light Amplifier, D-ILA is a high performance liquid crystal display device developed by JVC to meet various requirements for projectors. The device supports high resolution, high brightness and large display size, all of which are necessary for high quality pictures ranging from presentation by PC to digital HDTV home theater.

D_Link
D-Link is the corporate name of a designer and manufacturer of networking, broadband, digital, voice and data communications solutions. The company offers consumer devices in addition to providing network connectivity solutions to small and medium-sized business. The company's products and services include networking solutions for wireless bridging, network storage, cable and DSL modems, PoE adapters, network adapters, routers and more. D-Link was founded in 1986.

D_VHS
Short for Digital VHS D-VHS is a VHS format capable of storing digital signals on the magnetic  tape. It offers more capacity than traditional VHS and also can record compressed HDTV signals.

D_L
In chat abbreviations D/L is short for download. Chat abbreviations are commonly used in Internet and online communications mediums such as e-mail, IRC, instant messaging, or through SMS. See also Text Messaging Abbreviations in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia for definitions of hundreds of instant messaging, SMS and chat abbreviations, plus a guide to smiley faces and emoticons."  

D1
A resolution standard for TV and DVD-Video. In the NTSC system, Full D1 represents 720x480 pixels. The specifications for D1 TV and DVD-Video are as follows:TV PAL: 704x576TV NTSC: 704x480DVD-Video PAL: 720x576 (MPEG2)DVD-Video NTSC: 720x480 (MPEG2)

D2D
Short for disk-to-disk, a type of data storage backup in which the data is copied from a disk-typically a hard disk-to another disk-such as another hard disk or other disk storage medium. In a D2D system, the disk that the data is being copied from typically is referred to as the primary disk and the disk that the data is copied to typically is called the secondary or backup disk.  Contrast with D2T. One advantage of a D2D system over a D2T system is that backup files can be accessed directly just like any disk system. Tapes, conversely, have to be searched linearly and are not as expedient at retrieving data.

D2D2T
Short for disk-to-disk-to-tape, D2D2T is an archiving device where data is first backed up on a disk system, but then is spooled to a tape or an optical storage system. The D2D2T device can help eliminate data loss issues companies experience with tape drive or tape failure. Using a D2D2T system of backup keeps a copy of the data on-site for faster retrieval but also enables you to keep tape copies off-site for disaster recovery purposes. D2D2T devices may be appliances, virtual tape or disk libraries.

D2T
Short for disk-to-tape, a type of data storage backup in which the data is copied from a disk-typically a hard disk-to a magnetic tape. D2T systems are used widely in enterprises that require the safe storage of vital information in the case of disaster recovery so it can perform data recovery.

DAA
Short for Data Access Arrangement, part of a modem��s system for interfacing with a telephone network. The DAA provides the analog circuits that electrically isolate the modem from the phone line, separating the modem from the telephone line��s higher voltage. The FCC requires this feature of any device that connects to the PSTN, including fax machines and set-top boxes, and most manufacturers build modems around an FCC-approved DAA design.

DAC
(1) Short for digital-to-analog converter.(2) Short for Discretionary Access Control.

Discretionary_Access_Control
In computer security, Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is a type of access control in which a user has complete control over all the programs it owns and executes, and also determines the permissions other users have those those files and programs. Because DAC requires permissions to be assigned to those who need access, DAC is commonly called described as a "need-to-know" access model.  Contrast with Mandatory Access Control (MAC) which is determined by the administrator.

DACS
Short for digital access and cross-connect system. 

daemon
Pronounced DEE-mun or DAY-mun. A process that runs in the background and performs a specified operation at predefined times or in response to certain events. The term daemon is a UNIX term, though many other operating systems provide support for daemons, though they're sometimes called other names. Windows, for example, refers to daemons as System Agents and services.
Typical daemon processes include print spoolers, e-mail handlers, and other programs that perform administrative tasks for the operating system. The term comes from Greek mythology, where daemons were guardian spirits.
 

DAFS
Short for Direct Access File System.

Direct_Access_File_System
Direct Access File System (DAFS) is a file-access sharing protocol that uses memory-to-memory interconnect architectures, such as VI and InfiniBand. DAFS is designed for storage area networks (SANs) to provide bulk data transfer directly between the application buffers of two machines without having to packetize the data. With DAFS an application can transfer data to and from application buffers without using the operating system, which frees up the processor and operating system for other processes and allows files to be accessed by servers using several different operating systems.

daisy_chain
(n) A hardware configuration in which devices are connected one to another in a series. The SCSI  interface , for example, supports a daisy chain of up to 7 devices.  (v) To connect devices in a daisy chain pattern.   

daisy_wheel_printer
A type of printer that produces letter-quality type. A daisy-wheel printer works on the same principle as a ball-head typewriter. The daisy wheel is a disk made of plastic or metal on which characters stand out in relief along the outer edge. To print a character, the printer rotates the disk until the desired letter is facing the paper. Then a hammer strikes the disk, forcing the character to hit an ink ribbon, leaving an impression of the character on the paper. You can change the daisy wheel to print different fonts.  Daisy-wheel printers cannot print graphics, and in general they are noisy and slow, printing from 10 to about 75 characters per second. As the price of laser and ink-jet printers has declined, and the quality of dot-matrix printers has improved, daisy-wheel printers have become obsolete. 

DAL
Short for dedicated access line, a telecommunications line that reserves its data transmission capability for a specific user. The DAL typically is supplied by the local telephone company, but the local company does not switch calls on the line.

Dalvik
A virtual machine optimized for mobile devices that was designed and written by Dan Bornstein and other Google engineers. Dalvik is a part of the software stack that makes up the Android platform.  According to Google's Android documentation, the Dalvik VM is an interpreter-only virtual machine that executes files in the Dalvik Executable (.dex) format, a format that is optimized for efficient storage and memory-mappable execution. The virtual machine is register-based, and it can run classes compiled by a Java language compiler that have been transformed into its native format.

DAM
Short for digital asset management, a system that creates a centralized repository for digital files that allows the content to be archived, searched and retrieved. The digital content is stored in databases called asset repositories while metadata such as photo captions, article key words, advertiser names, contact names, file names or low-resolution thumbnail images are stored in separate databases called media catalogs and point to the original items.  Digital asset management also is known as enterprise digital asset management, media asset management or digital asset warehousing.

DAMA
Short for Demand-Assigned Multiple Access, DAMA is a satellite channel access protocol that provides a highly efficient means of instantaneously assigning channels in a transponder according to immediate traffic demands. DAMA essentially matches user demands to available satellite capacity.
See also VSAT.

damage_over_time
Abbreviated as DOT, in video and computer games, damage over time means the damage on a human or computer player character that is distributed over a period of time, usually until the character obtains help or a cure in the game level. For example, in many games, poison damage or spells can be a type of DOT. The player will see the continuing effects of the DOT by viewing their health level in the HUD. Also see  All About Multiplayer PC Gaming in Webopedia's "Did You Know...?" section.

DAML
Short for DARPA Agent Markup Language, DAML is a semantic markup language that is specifically an extension to XML and the Resource Description Framework (RDF). DAML is used for the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) and compared to the XML standard it offers a better capacity to express semantics (describing objects and the relationships between objects), which means a much higher level of interoperability between Web sites.

DAML_plus_OIL
The latest release of DAML, DAML+OIL  is a semantic markup language for Web resources, but extends DAML by providing a rich set of constructs to create ontologies and to markup information so that it is machine readable and understandable.

DAN
Short for Desk Area Network DAN is an architecture for a  multimedia workstation that is based around an ATM interconnect. The architecture is designed to interconnect workstations, multimedia devices and bridges to other networks. Traditionally, multimedia devices were connected to workstations. However, in a Desk Area Network these local devices are connected directly to the network.

DAO
(1) Short for data access objects, objects that work with the Jet database engine. DAO objects are generally created with Visual Basic. Once created, a DAO object can be accessed and manipulated by any application that can use the Jet engine. This includes all of the applications in Microsoft Office, such as MS-Word, MS-Access, and Excel.  (2) Short for disk at once, a method of recording to CD-R disks in which all data is written in a single session. 

dark_archive
(n.) In reference to data storage, an archive that cannot be accessed by any users. Access to the data is either limited to a set few individuals or completely restricted to all. The purpose of a dark archive is to function as a repository for information that can be used as a failsafe during disaster recovery.  Compare to a light archive.

dark_fiber
Dark fiber refers to unused fiber-optic cable. Often times companies lay more lines than what's needed in order to curb costs of having to do it again and again. The dark strands can be leased to individuals or other companies who want to establish optical connections among their own locations.   In this case, the fiber is neither controlled by nor connected to the phone company. Instead, the company or individual provides the necessary components to make it functional. 

darknet
Short for dark Internet, in file sharing terminology, a darknet is a Internet or private network, where information and content are shared by darknet participants anonymously. Darknets are popular with users who share copy protected files as the service will let users send and receive files anonymously  that is, users cannot be traced, tracked or personally identified. Usually, darknets are not easily accessible via regular Web browsers.

DARPA_Agent_Markup_Language
See DAML.

darrloz
A worm that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the PHP scripting language to attempt to gain access to a computer or device. Linux.Darrloz uses the vulnerability to seek administrative privileges by providing commonly-used login usernames and passwords. If Darrloz gains access to the computer, it leaves a backdoor on the infected system or device that allows the cyber criminal to issue commands at any point in time.
While Linux.Darrloz primarily targets Linux distributions, the worm has received considerable attention from the security industry as a potential security threat to the Internet of Things (IoT). There is evidence of Darrloz variants having been created specifically for chipsets utilized by home routers, set-top boxes, entertainment devices, security cameras and similar Internet-enabled devices.
This has prompted concerns that as common, everyday objects like household appliances, security systems and automobiles become more and more Internet-enabled (i.e. The Internet of Things), security threats such as Linux.Darrloz could present considerable risks to computers and connected devices as well as those who use them.

dart-programming-language
Dart is an open source, structured Web programming language developed by Google and announced to the public in 2011. Google intended this Web programming language to replace JavaScript, as it addresses several key problems with the JavaScript language.


direct_attached_storage
DAS is short for direct attached storage.
Direct attached storage (DAS), also called direct attach storage, is digital storage that is attached directly to a computer or a server. In other words, DAS isn't part of a storage network. The most familiar example of DAS is the internal hard drive in a laptop or desktop PC. In practice, the phrase direct attached storage is used most often in reference to dedicated storage arrays attached directly to servers. It is used to distinguish DAS from networked storage arrangements, like SAN or NAS devices.
DAS Devices Explained
DAS can refer to a single drive or a group of drives that are connected together, as in a RAID array. In addition, DAS devices can be housed inside a PC or server (as is the case with internal hard drives) or outside the PC or server (as is the case with external hard drives and storage appliances). Multiple systems can use the same DAS device, as long as each PC or server has a separate connection to the storage device.


DASD
Short for Direct Access Storage Device, and pronounced daz-dee, another name for disk drive in the world of mainframes. 

DashPC
A Linux software platform that delivers multimedia including DVDs, MP3s, CDs, Radio, navigation, Games, Engine Diagnostics, and Wireless Networking capability for carputers, also called car PCs. DashPC is a registered trademark of Dashwerks.

DAT
Acronym for digital audio tape, a type of magnetic tape that uses a scheme called helical scan to record data. A DAT cartridge is slightly larger than a credit card in width and height and contains a magnetic tape that can hold from 2 to 24 gigabytes of data. It can support data transfer rates of about 2 MBps. Like other types of tapes, DATs are sequential-access media.  The most common format for DAT cartridges is DDS (digital data storage). 

data
(1) Data is distinct pieces of information, usually formatted in a special way. All software is divided into two general categories: data and programs. Programs are collections of instructions for manipulating data.
Data can exist in a variety of forms -- as numbers or text on pieces of paper, as bits and bytes stored in electronic memory, or as facts stored in a person's mind.
Strictly speaking, data is the plural of datum, a single piece of information. In practice, however, people use data as both the singular and plural form of the word.
(2) The term data is often used to distinguish binary machine-readable information from textual human-readable information. For example, some applications make a distinction between data files (files that contain binary data) and text files (files that contain ASCII data).
(3) In database management systems, data files are the files that store the database information, whereas other files, such as index files and data dictionaries, store administrative information, known as metadata.

Webopedia Resources 


data_at_rest
The term used to describe all data in storage but excludes any data that frequently traverses the network or that which resides in temporary memory. Data at rest includes but is not limited to archived data, data which is not accessed or changed frequently, files stored on hard drives, USB thumb drives, files stored on backup tape and disks, and also files stored off-site or on a storage area network (SAN).

data_at_rest_protection
Data at rest is subject to threats from hackers and other malicious threats. To prevent this data from being accessed, modified or stolen, organizations will often employ security protection measures such as password protection, data encryption, or a combination of both. The security options used for this type of data are commonly referred to as  data at rest protection (DARP). 

data_buffer
In printer terminology, the data buffer is the temporary memory on the printer where page information is stored prior to and during the printing process.

data-center
Data centers are physical or virtual infrastructure used by enterprises to house computer, server and networking systems and components for the company's information technology (IT) needs, which typically involve storing, processing and serving large amounts of mission-critical data to clients in a client/server architecture.
A data center, or datacenter, often requires extensive redundant or backup power supply systems, cooling systems, redundant networking connections and policy-based security systems for running the enterprise's core applications.
Data center management involves ensuring the reliability of both the connections to the data center as well as the mission-critical information contained within the data center's storage. It also entails efficiently placing application workloads on the most cost-effective compute resource available.

data-center-consolidation-it-consolidation
The phrase data center consolidation (also called "IT consolidation") refers to an organization's strategy to reduce IT assets by using more efficient technologies.
Some of the consolidation technologies used in data centers today include server virtualization, storage virtualization, replacing mainframes with smaller blade server systems, cloud computing, better capacity planning and using tools for process automation.


data_center_container
Also called a modular data center or data center-in-a-box. A data center container is a method of deploying data centers that is designed to add data center capacity and to reduce an organization's cooling and power consumption costs. The container refers to a modular, portable self-contained environment that can be shipped and deployed. The container is portable, so it can be relocated or deployed in non-traditional data centers, such as urban spaces. A data center container is also faster to deploy than a traditional data center.
 
An example of a container is HP's Performance Optimized Datacenters, or PODs, a 40-foot shipping container with up to 22 racks of servers inside - pre-installed and ready to go. Container data centers have become popularized by vendors like Sun Microsystems and Rackable Systems and are considered to be a part of the modern data center.

data_center_economizer
In data center terminology an air economizer is part of the data center cooling infrastructure. An air economizer can reduce data center power consumption by  leveraging cooler outdoor air temperatures to cool the hardware and facility.
In a typical scenario, air economizers draw in cool air from outside and expel hot air (generated inside the facility) outdoors, instead of cooling and recirculating the hot air from servers. Water economizers can also be used to remove heat from the chilled water loop by a heat exchange process with outdoor air.
According to The Green Grid (TGG), an international, non-profit consortium working to enhance data center resource efficiency, there are two main economizer technologies commonly used in data centers:

data_center_management
Data center management refers to the role of an individual within the data center (data center manager) who is responsible for overseeing technical and IT issues within the data center. This includes computer and server operations, data entry, data security, data quality control and management of the services and applications used for data processing.


data_center_tiers
A four tier system that provides a simple and effective means for identifying different data center site infrastructure design topologies. The Uptime Institute's tiered classification system is an industry standard approach to site infrastructure functionality addresses common benchmarking standard needs. The four tiers, as classified by The Uptime Institute include the following:


Tier 1: composed of a single path for power and cooling distribution, without redundant components, providing 99.671% availability.
Tier II: composed of a single path for power and cooling distribution, with redundant components, providing 99.741% availability
Tier III: composed of multiple active power and cooling distribution paths, but only one path active, has redundant components, and is concurrently maintainable, providing 99.982% availability
Tier IV: composed of multiple active power and cooling distribution paths, has redundant components, and is fault tolerant, providing 99.995% availability.



data_cleansing
(1) Also referred to as data scrubbing, the act of detecting and removing and/or correcting a database��s dirty data (i.e., data that is incorrect, out-of-date, redundant, incomplete, or formatted incorrectly). The goal of data cleansing is not just to clean up the data in a database but also to bring consistency to different sets of data that have been merged from separate databases. Sophisticated software applications are available to clean a database��s data using algorithms, rules and look-up tables, a task that was once done manually and therefore still subject to human error.  (2) In a RAID system, the act of correcting parity bit errors so that drives remain synchronized.

data_compression
Storing data in a format that requires less space than usual.
Data compression is particularly useful in communications because it enables devices to transmit or store the same amount of data in fewer bits. There are a variety of data compression techniques, but only a few have been standardized. The CCITT has defined a standard data compression technique for transmitting faxes (Group 3 standard) and a compression standard for data communications through modems (CCITT V.42bis). In addition, there are file compression formats, such as ARC and ZIP.
Data compression is also widely used in backup utilities, spreadsheet applications, and database management systems. Certain types of data, such as bit-mapped graphics, can be compressed to a small fraction of their normal size.

data_custodian
In e-discovery terminology, the data custodian is usually the person responsible for, or the person with administrative control over, granting access to an organization's documents or electronic files while protecting the data as defined by the organization's security policy or its standard IT practices.

data_deduplication
Data deduplication is a technique for reducing the amount of storage space an organization needs to save its data. In most organizations, the storage systems contain duplicate copies of many pieces of data. For example, the same file may be saved in several different places by different users, or two or more files that aren't identical may still include much of the same data. Deduplication eliminates these extra copies by saving just one copy of the data and replacing the other copies with pointers that lead back to the original copy. Companies frequently use deduplication in backup and disaster recovery applications, but it can be used to free up space in primary storage as well.
In its simplest form, deduplication takes place on the file level; that is, it eliminates duplicate copies of the same file. This kind of deduplication is sometimes called file-level deduplication or single instance storage (SIS). Deduplication can also take place on the block level, eliminating duplicated blocks of data that occur in non-identical files. Block-level deduplication frees up more space than SIS, and a particular type known as variable block or variable length deduplication has become very popular. Often the phrase "data deduplication" is used as a synonym for block-level or variable length deduplication.


data_dictionary
In database management systems, a file that defines the basic organization of a database. A data dictionary contains a list of all files in the database, the number of records in each file, and the names and types of each field. Most database management systems keep the data dictionary hidden from users to prevent them from accidentally destroying its contents.
Data dictionaries do not contain any actual data from the database, only bookkeeping information for managing it. Without a data dictionary, however, a database management system cannot access data from the database.
 

data_entry
The process of entering data into a computerized database or spreadsheet. Data entry can be performed by an individual typing at a keyboard or by a machine entering data electronically.


data_flow_model
Data flow model is a graphical representation produced by data flow modeling. Also referred to as a data flow diagram (DFD).

data_flow_modeling
The process of identifying, modeling and documenting how data moves around an information system. Data flow modeling examines processes (activities that transform data from one form to another), data stores (the holding areas for data), external entities (what sends data into a system or receives data from a system, and data flows (routes by which data can flow).  Data flow modeling is one of the foundations of the Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method.  Data flow modeling also is called data flow diagramming

data_glove
A glove equipped with sensors that sense the movements of the hand and interfaces those movements with a computer. Data gloves are commonly used in virtual reality environments where the user sees an image of the data glove and can manipulate the movements of the virtual environment using the glove.  Also see haptic.

data_independence
The separation of data from the programs that use the data. Nearly all modern applications are based on the principle of data independence. In fact, the whole concept of a database management system (DBMS) supports the notion of data independence since it represents a system for managing data separately from the programs that use the data. In contrast, it is possible to write applications in which the data being processed is actually represented in the program's source code. This data-dependentapproach is very inflexible because it makes it difficult to modify the data and it also makes the data inaccessible to other programs.


Data_Infrastructure_Hygiene
Practices that promote or preserve the shape of  an entire data infrastructure (e.g.,  network, servers,  databases, storage,  software). Data Infrastructure Hygiene essentially refers to any activity that reduces the stress of information growth on the data infrastructure and enables the efficient access, movement and protection of data while reducing overall infrastructure and maintenance costs. Such practices include active archiving of relational databases, e-mail archiving, as well as document archiving.

data_integrity
Refers to the validity of data. Data integrity can be compromised in a number of ways:

Human errors when data is entered
Errors that occur when data is transmitted from one computer to another
Software bugs or viruses
Hardware malfunctions, such as disk crashes
Natural disasters, such as fires and floods



data_logging
(dā´t& log-ing) (n.) The process of using a computer to collect data through sensors, analyze the data and save and output the results of the collection and analysis. Data logging also implies the control of how the computer collects and analyzes the data.
Data logging is commonly used in scientific experiments and in monitoring systems where there is the need to collect information faster than a human can possibly collect the information and in cases where accuracy is essential. Examples of the types of information a data logging system can collect include temperatures, sound frequencies, vibrations, times, light intensities, electrical currents, pressure and changes in states of matter.

data_marshalling
The process of gathering data and transforming it into a standard format before it is transmitted over a network so that the data can transcend network boundaries. In order for an object to be moved around a network, it must be converted into a data stream that corresponds with the packet structure of the network transfer protocol. This conversion is known as data marshalling. Data pieces are collected in a message buffer before they are marshaled. When the data is transmitted, the receiving computer converts the marshaled data back into an object.  Data marshalling is required when passing the output parameters of a program written in one language as input to a program written in another language.

data_mart
A database, or collection of databases, designed to help managers make strategic decisions about their business. Whereas a data warehouse combines databases across an entire enterprise, data marts are usually smaller and focus on a particular subject or department. Some data marts, called dependent data marts,are subsets of larger data warehouses.
Also spelled as datamart.


data_migration
There are two common definitions for the phrase data migration: Translating data and moving data.
(1) Translating Data
Data migration is used to describe the process of translating data from one format to another. Data migration is necessary when an organization decides to use a new computing systems or database management system that is incompatible with the current system. Typically, data migration is performed by a set of customized programs or scripts that automatically transfer the data.
(2) Moving Data
Data migration is a phrase used to describe the process of moving data from one storage device to another. In this context, data migration is the same as Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM).

data_miner
(n.) A software application that monitors and/or analyzes the activities of a computer, and subsequently its user, of the purpose of collecting information that typically will be used for marketing purposes. The two most common forms of data miners are data mining programs that an organization uses to analyze its own data to look for significant patterns, and spyware programs that are uploaded to a user��s computer to monitor the user��s activity and send the data back to the organization, typically so that the organization can send the user targeted advertising.

data_mining
Data mining requires a class of database applications that look for hidden patterns in a group of data that can be used to predict future behavior. For example, data mining software can help retail companies find customers with common interests.
The phrase data mining is commonly misused to describe software that presents data in new ways. True data mining software doesn't just change the presentation, but actually discovers previously unknown relationships among the data.
Data mining is popular in the science and mathematical fields but also is utilized increasingly by marketers trying to distill useful consumer data from Web sites.

data_mirroring
The act of copying data from one location to a storage device in real time. Because the data is copied in real time, the information stored from the original location is always an exact copy of the data from the production device. Data mirroring is useful in the speedy recovery of critical data after a disaster. Data mirroring can be implemented locally or offsite at a completely different location.

data_modeling
The analysis of data objects and their relationships to other data objects. Data modeling is often the first step in database design and object-oriented programming as the designers first create a conceptual model of how data items relate to each other. Data modeling involves a progression from conceptual model to logical model to physical schema.

data_modelling
See data modeling.

data_processing
(1) Refers to a class of programs that organize and manipulate data, usually large amounts of numeric data. Accounting programs are the prototypical examples of data processing applications. In contrast, word processors, which manipulate text rather than numbers, are not usually referred to as data processing applications.
(2) Same as Information Technology (IT), refers to all computing functions within an enterprise.


data_recovery
(n.) The salvaging of data stored on damaged media, such as magnetic disks and tapes. There are a number of software products that can help recover data damaged by a disk crash or virus. In addition, there are companies that specialize in data recovery. Of course, not all data is recoverable, but data recovery specialists can often restore a surprisingly high percentage of the data on damaged media.


data_scrubbing
Same as data cleansing.

Data_Sending_Trojan
A type of a Trojan horse that is designed to provide the attacker with sensitive data such as passwords, credit card information, log files, e-mail address or IM contact lists. These Trojans can look for specific pre-defined data (e.g., just credit card information or passwords), or they could install a keylogger and send all recorded keystrokes back to the attacker.See also Trojan horse.

data_server
Data server is the  phrase used to describe computer software and hardware (a database platform)  that delivers database services. Also called a database server it also performs tasks such as data analysis, storage, data manipulation,  archiving, and other tasks using client/server architecture.See also  database server.

data_services
A service provider that enables data access on demand to users regardless of their geographic location.  Also called Data as a Service (DaaS), data services are similar to Software as a Service (SaaS) in that the information is stored in the cloud and is accessible by a wide range of systems and devices.
Data services can eliminate redundancy and streamline costs by housing critical data in one location, enabling the data to be accessed and/or updated by multiple users while ensuring a single point for updates.  Potential drawbacks to data services include server downtime from the data service provider, data loss in the event of a disaster, and the security of the data, both in its stored location and in the transmission of the data among users.

data_set
(1) A named collection of data in an IBM mainframe operating system. A data set in an IBM mainframe is the equivalent of a file in other operating systems, such as Mac OS, Windows and UNIX, for PCs.  (2) A deprecated term for modem.

data_structure
In programming, the term data structure refers to a scheme for organizing related pieces of information. The basic types of data structures include:

files


lists


arrays


records


trees


tables

Each of these basic structures has many variations and allows different operations to be performed on the data.


data_synchronization
Data synchronization technologies are designed to synchronize a single set of data between two or more devices, automatically copying changes back and forth. For example, a user's contact list on one mobile device can be synchronized with other mobile devices or computers. Data synchronization can be local synchronization where the device and computer are side-by-side and data is transferred or remote synchronization when a user is mobile and the data is synchronized over a mobile network. [Source: Adapted from Nokia]

data_transfer_rate
The speed with which data can be transmitted from one device to another. Data rates are often measured in megabits (million bits) or megabytes (million bytes) per second. These are usually abbreviated as Mbps and MBps,respectively.
Another term for data transfer rate is throughput.


data_type
In programming, classification of a particular type of information. It is easy for humans to distinguish between different types of data. We can usually tell at a glance whether a number is a percentage, a time, or an amount of money. We do this through special symbols -- %, :, and $ -- that indicate the data's type. Similarly, a computer uses special internal codes to keep track of the different types of data it processes.
Most programming languages require the programmer to declare the data type of every data object, and most database systems require the user to specify the type of each data field. The available data types vary from one programming language to another, and from one database application to another, but the following usually exist in one form or another:

integer : In more common parlance, whole number; a number that has no fractional part.
floating-point :A number with a decimal point. For example, 3 is an integer, but 3.5 is a floating-point number.
character  (text  ): Readable text


data_vaulting
The process of sending data off-site, where it can be protected from hardware failures, theft, and other threats. Several companies now provide Web backup services that will compress, encrypt, and periodically transmit a customer's data to a remote vault. In most cases the vaults will feature auxiliary power supplies, powerful computers, and manned security. Also referred to as a remote backup service (RBS). 

data_virtualization

HTML clipboard
Data virtualization is a methodology that takes a layered approach to  dealing with huge volumes of data from disparate sources. The phrase  virtualization is used because data virtualization is the aggregation of the data from disparate sources, including databases, systems and storage, to create a single virtual view from within a front-end systems; such as  applications or dashboards. Data virtualization is commonly associated with business or enterprise applications including sales force automation (SFA), customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP) and business intelligence (BI).

data_warehouse
Development of a data warehouse includes development of systems to extract data from operating systems plus installation of a warehouse database systemthat provides managers flexible access to the data.
The term data warehousing generally refers to the combination of many different databases across an entire enterprise. Contrast with data mart.


database

(1) Often abbreviated DB, a database is basically a collection of information organized in such a way that a computer program can quickly select desired pieces of data. You can think of a database as an electronic filing system.
Traditional databases are organized by fields, records, and files. A field is a single piece of information; a record is one complete set of fields; and a file is a collection of records. For example, a telephone book is analogous to a file. It contains a list of records, each of which consists of three fields: name, address, and telephone number.

database_engine
The part of a database management system (DBMS) that actually stores and retrieves data. Most DBMS's include an Application Programming Interface (API) that enables you to directly control the engine without going through the DBMS's user interface.  

database_server
Database server is the term used to refer to the back-end system of a database application using client/server architecture. The back-end, sometimes called a database server, performs tasks such as data analysis, storage, data manipulation, archiving, and other non-user specific tasks.
See also Database Management System.

database_shard
A database shard ("sharding") is the phrase used to describe a horizontal partition in a database or search engine. The idea behind sharding is to split data among multiple machines while ensuring that the data is always accessed from the correct place.
Since sharding spreads the database across multiple machines, the database programmer specifies explicit sharding rules to determine which machines any piece of data will be stored on.
Sharding may also be referred to as horizontal scaling or horizontal partitioning.

database_software
Database software is the phrase used to describe any software that is designed for creating databases and managing the information stored in them. Sometimes referred to as database management systems (DBMS), database software tools are primarily used for storing, modifying, extracting, and searching for information within a database. Database software is used for a number of reasons in any industry - from keeping your bookkeeping on task, compiling client lists to running your online Web site.
Because they have so many uses, there are dozens of database software programs available. The options have gone beyond Oracle or Microsoft Access to encompass FileMaker, Avanquest and Delicious Monster Software for options tailored to a variety of needs. Some of the more popular database software applications include desktop solutions like Microsoft Access and FileMaker Pro and server solutions like MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle.

DataBurst_Cache
A buzzword marketing term used by Dell to describe the typical 8, 16, or 32-MB of disk cache in the hard drive that acts as a buffer between the drive and computer system.  When browsing Dell desktops and workstations online, a typical entry using the term DataBurst Cache may be as follows:  (example) 320-GB Serial ATA Hard Drive (7200RPM) w/ DataBurst Cache. See disk cache.

datagram
(dā´t&-gram) (n.) A data packet that is sent over an IP network.

Datagram_Congestion_Control_Protocol
DCCP, short for Datagram Congestion Control Protocol, is a minimal general purpose transport-layer protocol that minimizes the overhead of packet  header size or end-node processing as much as possible. DCCP provides the establishment, maintenance and teardown of an unreliable packet flow, as well as the congestion control of that packet flow. [Adapted from Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (dccp)]

Datalog
A query language for deductive databases that is based on logical facts and rules. It's similar to  Prolog which has no data structures and is based on formal logic. See also  Prolog

DataPad
A DataPad is a small keyboard designed to work with a PDA and similar handheld devices. The DataPad allows you to use your PDA without using the  stylus pen. Some manufacturers will refer to this hardware as simply a  mini keyboard.

DataPortability
The DataPortability Working Group is an industry Data Portability standards working group that educates, designs and advocates interoperable DataPortability to users, developers and vendors. The DataPortability Working Group defines DataPortability as "the option to share or move your personal data between trusted applications and vendors".

daughtercard
A printed circuit board that plugs into another circuit board (usually the motherboard). A daughtercard is similar to an expansion board, but it accesses the motherboard components (memory and CPU) directly instead of sending data through the slower expansion bus.  A daughtercard is also called a daughterboard.  See "What You Need to Know About Motherboards" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

day_forward
The process of scanning, indexing and storing documents to an imaging system as they are produced or received in the normal course of business. Day forward is a term most often associated with backfile conversion.

DB_25
A 25-pin electrical connector used for both serial and parallel ports on PCs.

DB2
Short for Database 2, a family of relational database products offered by IBM. DB2 provides an open database environment that runs on a wide variety of computing platforms. A DB2 database can grow from a small single-user application to a large multi-user system. Using SQL, users can obtain data simultaneously from DB2 and other databases. DB2 includes a range of application development and management tools.
 

DBA
Short for database administrator is is the title given to the person responsible for managing many aspects of a database including archiving, performance, security, testing, and other tasks.

DBA_dashboard
The SQL Server DBA dashboard tool is both a DBA and a TSQL programmer tool. The main goal of this tool is to allow DBAs and programmers to quickly identify performance, SQL Agent and disk space issues associated with a single instance of SQL Server. The dashboard tool can be installed and run against any SQL Server 2005 SP2 or SQL Server 2008 instance. The SQL Server DBA dashboard provides 39 different performance and disk space related reports with a single click from the main dashboard page.   See "SQL Server DBA Dashboard" on "Database Journal" for more information on this term.

dBASE
A popular database management system produced by Ashton Tate Corporation. The original version, called Vulcan, was created by Wayne Ratliff. In 1981, Ashton-Tate bought Vulcan and marketed it as dBASE II. Subsequent versions with additional features are known as dBASE III, dBASE III+, and dBASE IV, all of which were owned and developed by Borland Corporation (now Inprise), but were sold to dBASE Inc. in March, 1999. The current version for Windows 95 and higher is dBASE PLUS, which is available with a twelve-month on-line upgrades, fixes, and updates. The program CD also includes older versions of dBASE: dBASE 5.0 for DOS; and the 16-bit version, Visual dBASE 5.7 for Windows.  The dBASE format for storing data has become a de facto standard, and is supported by nearly all database management and spreadsheet systems. Even systems that do not use the dBASE format internally are able to import and export data in dBASE format.  

DBCS
Short for double-byte character set, a character set that uses two-byte (16-bit) characters rather than one-byte (8-bit) characters. Some languages, such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean, have writing schemes with many different characters that cannot be represented with single-byte codes such as ASCII and EBCDIC. In a single-byte character set, the possible number of binary combinations is 256; the number increases to 65,536 in a double byte character set.  DBCS characters must be used with hardware and software that support the double-byte format.

database_management_system_DBMS
A database management system (DBMS) is a collection of programs that enables you to store, modify, and extract information from a database. There are many different types of database management systems, ranging from small systems that run on personal computers to huge systems that run on mainframes.
Examples of Database Applications
The following are examples of database applications:

computerized library systems

automated teller machines

flight reservation systems

computerized parts inventory systems



DCC
Short for Direct Cable Connection, a Windows 95 feature that enables two computers to be connected via a serial or parallel cable. Once connected, the two computers function as if they were on a local-area network (LAN). Either computer can access files on the other computer. But because DCC does not require network interface cards (NICs), it is less expensive and simpler. The limitations are that it can connect only two PCs, and the data transfer rate is slower than with a true LAN. 

DCE
(1) Short for Distributed Computing Environment, a suite of technology services developed by The Open Group for creating distributed applications that run on different platforms. DCE services include:  Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) Security Service Directory Service Time Service Threads Service Distributed File Service   DCE is a popular choice for very large systems that require robust security and fault tolerance.  (2) Short for Data Communications Equipment, a device that communicates with a Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) device in RS-232C communications. See DTE for more information. 

data-center-infrastructure-management
Data center infrastructure management (DCIM) generally refers to the management of the human resources and tools required to handle all physical assets and resources in the data center to obtain a single pane view of the entire infrastructure.
DCIM Benefits
Data center infrastructure management enables mangers to capture real time and detailed information about the data center to increase efficiency, reduce costs and maintain availability. DCIM is considered to be a business process that helps visualize and align power, space, cooling and capacity of the environment to meet business objectives.
For example, a data center that experiences downtime can leverage DCIM to obtain a real time view of power consumption to help reduce energy use and prevent unplanned outages by planning the DCIM functions to address the biggest problems first. DCIM basically provides the means to manage data and energy resources as the data center infrastructure changes over time.

DCL
Short for Digital Command Language DCL is the scripting language used by most operating systems that were sold by DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation). DCL scripts look similar to any scripting language, with the exception being that All DCL verbs in a script are preceded with a $ symbol. In January 1998, DEC agreed to be acquired by Compaq, which was then acquired by Hewlett-Packard.

DCOM
Short for Distributed Component Object Model, an extension of the Component Object Model (COM) that allows COM components to communicate across network boundaries. Traditional COM components can only perform interprocess communication across process boundaries on the same machine. DCOM uses the RPC mechanism to transparently send and receive information between COM components (i.e., clients and servers) on the same network. DCOM was first made available in 1995 with the initial release of Windows NT 4.  DCOM serves the same purpose as IBM's DSOM protocol, which is the most popular implementation of CORBA. Unlike CORBA, which runs on many operating systems, DCOM is currently implemented only for Windows. 

DCT
Short for Discrete Cosine Transform, a technique for representing waveform data as a weighted sum of cosines. DCT is commonly used for data compression, as in JPEG. This usage of DCT results in lossy compression. DCT itself does not lose data; rather, data compression technologies that rely on DCT approximate some of the coefficients to reduce the amount of data.  

DD
Online chat abbreviation for "dear (or darling) daughter ". DD is commonly used in newsgroups/a>, chat rooms, instant messaging,  text messaging, SMS, e-mail and other real time text-based communications. See also "Text Messaging Abbreviations" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia for definitions to hundreds of frequently used chat abbreviations.

DD_WRT
A free open source firmware that can be loaded onto a compatible wireless router and used to create a hotspot to share your Internet connection.   See "Create Your Own Hotspot (Using DD-WRT)" on "Wi-Fi Planet". See also"Public Wi-Fi Hotspots" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia. See also "Wireless Tips for Road Warriors" in the "Did You Know...?" section of Webopedia. 

DDC
Short for Display Data Channel, a VESA standard for communication between a monitor and a video adapter. Using DDC, a monitor can inform the video card about its properties, such as maximum resolution and color depth. The video card can then use this information to ensure that the user is presented with valid options for configuring the display. 

DDE
Acronym for Dynamic Data Exchange, an interprocess communication (IPC) system built into the Macintosh, Windows, and OS/2 operating systems. DDE enables two running applications to share the same data. For example, DDE makes it possible to insert a spreadsheet chart into a document created with a word processor. Whenever the spreadsheet data changes, the chart in the document changes accordingly.  Although the DDE mechanism is still used by many applications, it is being supplanted by OLE, which provides greater control over shared data.    

DDL
Short for Data Definition Language, DDL is a computer language that is used to define data structures. In Database Management Systems (DBMS), it is used to specify a database scheme as a set of definitions (expressed in DDL). In SQL, the Data Definition Language (DDL) allows you to create, alter, and destroy database objects.

DDMS
Short for Dalvik Debug Monitor Service, DDMS is a GUI debugging application shipped with the Android SDK that provides screen capture, log dump and process examination capabilities.

DDO
Short for Dynamic Drive Overlay, specialized software that allows a BIOS that does not support LBA to access hard drives larger than 528MB.  For the hard drive to be recognized, the DDO must be loaded during the boot sequence, where it installs a small program that replaces some of the BIOS's drive access services with its own routines. In order to access the drive, the user must boot from the drive in which the overlay is installed.

DDoS_attack
DDoS is short for Distributed Denial of Service.
DDoS is a type of DOS attack where multiple compromised systems, which are often infected with a Trojan, are used to target a single system causing a  Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Victims of a DDoS attack consist of both the end targeted system and all systems maliciously used and controlled by the hacker in the distributed attack.
How DDoS Attacks Work
According to this report on eSecurityPlanet, in a DDoS attack, the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources – potentially hundreds of thousands or more. This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a single IP address; plus, it is very difficult to distinguish legitimate user traffic from attack traffic when spread across so many points of origin.
The Difference Between DoS and DDos Attacks
A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is different from a DDoS attack. The DoS attack typically uses one computer and one Internet connection to flood a targeted system or resource. The DDoS attack uses multiple computers and Internet connections to flood the targeted resource. DDoS attacks are often global attacks, distributed via botnets.
Types of DDoS Attacks
There are many types of DDoS attacks. Common attacks include the following:

Traffic attacks: Traffic flooding attacks send a huge volume of TCP, UDP and ICPM packets to the target. Legitimate requests get lost and these attacks may be accompanied by malware exploitation.
Bandwidth attacks: This DDos attack overloads the target with massive amounts of junk data. This results in a loss of network bandwidth and equipment resources and can lead to a complete denial of service.
Application attacks: Application-layer data messages can deplete resources in the application layer, leaving the target's system services unavailable.



DDP
(1) Short for Disk-based Data Protection, where a disk or RAID system is used as a data backup and archival system in place of tape.  (2) Short for Distributed Data Protection, a managed (or hosted) service that provides customers with online, scheduled, automated computer system data backup and self serve restoration.  (3) Short for Development Data Platform, a Web-based platform for data analysis, presentation and dissemination.

DDR
(1)Short for Dial-on-Demand Routing. DDR is a routing technique developed by Cisco that allows a user to utilize existing telephone lines, or public circuit-switched networks, to form a WANinstead of lines that are dedicated specifically to the WAN. DDR is typically implemented by users that do not need permanent, continuous links between sites on the WAN because the volume of traffic over the WAN is low and the transmissions are periodic as opposed to continuous. The connection only becomes active when data is sent to the remote site. When no data has been sent over the link for a specified amount of time, the link is disconnected.
Using DDR, a connection between sites is only established when a specific type of traffic initiates the call or when you a backup link is needed for redundancy or load sharing.
DDR is used in order to save on the costs of a dedicated WAN line for organizations that do not need permanent continuous connection and as a back-up by organizations that use the dedicated line for critical applications.

DDR_SDRAM
Short for Double Data Rate-Synchronous DRAM, a type of SDRAM that supports data transfers on both edges of each clock cycle (the rising and falling edges), effectively doubling the memory chip's data throughput. DDR-SDRAM also consumes less power, which makes it well-suited to notebook computers. DDR-SDRAM is also called SDRAM II. and DDRAM.
Also see the  Guide to System Memory page in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

DDR2_SDRAM
DDR2-SDRAM is high-performance main memory. Over its predecessor, DDR-SDRAM, DDR2-SDRAM offers greater bandwidth and density in a smaller package along with a reduction in power consumption. In addition DDR2-SDRAM offers new features and functions that enable higher a clock rate and data rate operations of 400 MHz, 533 MHz, 667 MHz, and above. DDR2 transfers 64 bits of data twice every clock cycle. DDR2-SDRAM memory is not compatible with current DDR-SDRAM memory slots.See also DDR-SDRAM.

DDS
Abbreviation of Digital Data Storage, the industry standard for digital audio tape (DAT) formats. There are currently four kinds of DDS.   Type of DDSTape Length  in Meters Compression   Off  On  DDS-1 90  2 GB  4 GB  DDS-2 120  4 GB  8 GB  DDS-3 125  12 GB  24 GB  DDS-4 150  20 GB  40 GB    

de_facto_standard
A format, language, or protocol that has become a standard not because it has been approved by a standards organization but because it is widely used and recognized by the industry as being standard. Some examples of de facto standards include:  Hayes command set for controlling modems Kermit Communications Protocol Xmodem Communications Protocol Hewlett-Packard Printer Control Language (PCL) for laser printersPostScript page description language for laser printers The QWERTY system for typewriters and keyboards 

dead_key
(ded kē) (n.) A key on a computer's keyboard that when pressed by itself produces no output character but only works in conjunction with another key, effectively changing the output of the key that is pressed immediately after the dead key. For example, dead keys commonly are used when inputting characters with accent marks; the dead key is pressed, which indicates that the next letter input by the keyboard will appear with the accent mark. The dead key will modify only characters that are accepted in the language in which the user is typing. For example, if the user is typing a French word that contains an accented "e" and presses the dead key and then the letter "e," the "e" will appear with an accent; however, if the letter "t" is pressed instead of "e," the "t" will not appear since an accented "t" is not an accepted character in that language.

dead_pixel
A pixel on an LCD monitor that remains unlit, or black, when it should be activated and displaying a color. Each pixel on an LCD screen is made from three separate subpixels-one red, one green and one blue-that when combined form the colors that the users see on the monitor. A dead pixel occurs when the transistor that activates the amount of light that shows through all three subpixels malfunctions and results in a permanently black pixel. Dead pixels are rare and largely go unnoticed by the user. See "All About Monitors: CRT Vs. LCD" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia. See also "LCD Versus Plasma: An introduction to flat screen television technologies" in Webopedia's Quick Reference section. 

dead_tree_edition
Slang term used to describe any publication in its printed form when the same publication is available in a paperless version online. In hacker slang terminology, any printed manual or documentation that is freely available online is called treeware.

deadlock
A condition that occurs when two processes are each waiting for the other to complete before proceeding. The result is that both processes hang. Deadlocks occur most commonly in multitasking and client/server environments. Ideally, the programs that are deadlocked, or the operating system, should resolve the deadlock, but this doesn't always happen.
A deadlock is also called a deadly embrace.


deathmatch
Deathmatch, or DM, is a type of gameplay mode found in first-person-shooter games. The objective of a deathmatch is to frag as many players in the game as possible while keeping yourself from being fragged. When the game ends either by gamers reaching the end of the level or a preset time or frag count limit, the gamer who accumulated the most frags in the DM game is the winner of the deathmatch. Multiplayer games may also contain a single player game of deathmatch where the gamer plays against intelligent bots in the game locally, rather than against other gamers over the Internet. DM can also be set to a "teamplay deathmatch" mode where teams (called clans) work together to obtain a higher combined frag count than the opposing teams in the game.  The term deathmatch was coined by legendary game programmer John Romero while developing the popular FPS game DOOM. Also see  All About Multiplayer PC Gaming in Webopedia's "Did You Know...?" section.

Debian
Pronounced "deb-EE-uhn." Short for Debian GNU/Linux or Debian GNU/Hurd, an open source operating system that uses the Linux or Hurd kernel, respectively. Debian continues to be developed by more than 500 contributors who comprise the Debian Project. The software can be downloaded over the Internet or purchased on CD-ROM.  The Debian software project was started in 1993 by Ian Murdock. It��s name comes from a combination of the words Ian and Debra, Murdock��s wife.  The term Debian refers to both the operating system and/or the group that maintains it.

debian_goodies
Debian Goodies (the debian-goodies package) is a set of utilities that work with Debian packages and provide more information than you can get out of the standard APT (Advanced Package Tool) utilities. You can use Debian Goodies to find out which packages have releases, critical bugs, which ones hog the most disk space or use older versions of files that have been upgraded.

debug
(v.) To find and remove errors (bugs) from a software program. Bugs occur in programs when a line of code or an instruction conflicts with other elements of the code.

debugger
A special program used to find errors (bugs) in other programs. A debugger allows a programmer to stop a program at any point and examine and change the values of variables.   

DEC
Pronounced deck, and short for Digital Equipment Corporation, one of leading producers of workstations, servers, and high-end PCs. DEC also developed one of the leading Internet search engines called Alta Vista.  In January, 1998, DEC agreed to be acquired by Compaq, which was then acquired by Hewlett-Packard.

decibel
(de��ci��bel) A unit of measurement used to express relative difference in power or intensity, usually between two acoustic or electric signals, equal to ten times the common logarithm (an exponent used in mathematical calculations to depict the perceived levels) of the ratio of the two levels. [Adapted from The American Heritage Dictionary ]

decimal
Refers to numbers in base 10 (the numbers we use in everyday life). For example, the following are decimal numbers:  9  100345000  -256  Note that a decimal number is not necessarily a number with a decimal point in it. Numbers with decimal points (that is, numbers with a fractional part) are called fixed-point or floating-point numbers.  In addition to the decimal format, computer data is often represented in binary, octal, and hexadecimal formats.   

decision_support_system
Abbreviated DSS, the term refers to an interactive computerized system that gathers and presents data from a wide range of sources, typically for business purposes. DSS applications are systems and subsystems that help people make decisions based on data that is culled from a wide range of sources.
Examples of DSS
For example: a national on-line book seller wants to begin selling its products internationally but first needs to determine if that will be a wise business decision. The vendor can use a DSS to gather information from its own resources (using a tool such as OLAP) to determine if the company has the ability or potential ability to expand its business and also from external resources, such as industry data, to determine if there is indeed a demand to meet. The DSS will collect and analyze the data and then present it in a way that can be interpreted by humans. Some decision support systems come very close to acting as artificial intelligence agents.
DSS Applications
DSS applications are not single information resources, such as a database or a program that graphically represents sales figures, but the combination of integrated resources working together.

declare
In programming, to declare is to define the name and data type of a variable or other programming construct. Many programming languages, including C and Pascal, require you to declare variables before using them.  

decode
Decode refers to reversing the process of an encoding method. Data that has been encoded for storage or transmission is usually decoded for use and playback. Also see decoder, a device or program that translates encoded data into its original format. Contrast with encode.

decoder
A device or program that translates encoded data into its original format (e.g., it decodes the data). The term is often used in reference to MPEG-2 video and sound data, which must be decoded before it is output. Most DVD players, for example, include a decoder card whose sole function is to decode MPEG data. It is also possible to decode MPEG data in software, but this requires a powerful microprocessor. 

decoupled
Two or more systems that are able to transact without being connected, or coupled. The systems do not interact with each other, and also one system usually has only a very limited knowledge of any other system, and that knowledge is usually limited to information about shared interfaces. A decoupled system allows changes to be made to any one system without having an effect on any other system.
Also called uncoupled. See also coupling,  loose coupling, and tight coupling.

decrement
To subtract. For example, if you count down consecutively from 10 to 0, you decrement by 1. If you count down by twos, you decrement by 2. The opposite of decrementing is incrementing.   

decryption
The process of decoding data that has been encrypted into a secret format. Decryption requires a secret key or password.
 
 

DeCSS
Short for Decrypt CSS, an algorithm for circumventing the CSS copy protection used in DVDs, allowing the decryption of the digital data. In the U.S., the DeCSS algorithm is considered to be a violation of DMCA 1201.

DECT
Short for Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications DECT is a digital wireless technology that originated in Europe, but is now used worldwide. DECT is a radio technology for voice data applications (such as cordless telephones, wireless offices and even wireless telephone lines to the home). DECT uses time division multiple access (TDMA) to transmit radio signals to phones and is best-suited to smaller areas with a large number of users.  It has been designed and specified to work with many other types of network, such as the PSTN, ISDN, GSM and others.  DECT was formerly an acronym for Digital European Cordless Telecommunications, however the name of the technology has changed to reflect the global usage and acceptance of the technology.

dedicated
Reserved for a specific use. In communications, a dedicated channel  is a line reserved exclusively for one type of communication. This is the same as a leased line or private line.  A dedicated server  is a single computer in a network reserved for serving the needs of the network. For example, some networks require that one computer be set aside to manage communications between all the other computers. A dedicated server could also be a computer that manages printer resources. Note, however, that not all servers are dedicated. In some networks, it is possible for a computer to act as a server and perform other functions as well.  The opposite of dedicated is general purpose. 

dedicated_server
A dedicated server is a single computer in a network reserved for serving the needs of the network. For example, some networks require that one computer be set aside to manage communications between all the other computers. A dedicated server could also be a computer that manages printer resources. Note, however, that not all servers are dedicated. In some networks, it is possible for a computer to act as a server and perform other functions as well.
In the Web hosting business, a dedicated server is typically a rented service. The user rents the server, software and an Internet connection from the Web host.
See the Server Types page in the quick reference section of Webopedia for a comparison of server types.

deep_dialing
A VoIP service that enables users to skip the IVR (interactive voice response) menu of a company they are dialing to navigate immediately to the person within the company they want to talk to. Deep dialing was developed by Fonolo as a service to cut down on the time and frustration involved in contacting large, complex organizations over the phone. The deep-dialing process, according to Fonolo, is simple: You find the particular company you want to contact on Fonolo's Web site, visually scan through the phone menu and click on the appropriate link. Fonolo then dials the company, navigates the phone system and calls your phone. You answer and are connected to the desired point in the phone menu.

deep_link
(n.) A hyperlink either on a Web page or in the results of a search engine query to a page on a Web site other than the site��s home page. Typically, a Web site��s home page is the top page in the site��s hierarchy, and any page other than that is considered "deep."  For example, if a Web site linked to the Webopedia page http://www.webopedia.com/Term/D/deep_link.html, this would be considered a deep link because the site linked to one of Webopedia��s pages other than its home page, http://www.webopedia.com.  Some in the industry have opposed the proliferation of deep links as they drive users away from a site��s home page where there are advertisers paying for space based on page views.  (v.) To link to a page on a Web site other than its home page.

deep_pages
In Web site development a deep page is a Web page within your site that takes four or more clicks to access from the home page. Deep page lowers the quality of your Web site.

deep_Web
See invisible Web.

defacement
In Web site security terminology, the word defacement is most often used to describe the changing or defacing of a Web page or Web site by an unauthorized individual or process, usually a hacker.

default
A value or setting that a device or program automatically selects if you do not specify a substitute. For example, word processors have default margins and default page lengths that you can override or reset.  The default drive is the disk drive the computer accesses unless you specify a different disk drive. Likewise, the default directory  is the directory the operating system searches unless you specify a different directory.  The default can also be an action that a device or program will take. For example, some word processors generate backup files by default.   

default_gateway
(1)The gateway in a network that a computer will use to access another network if a gateway is not specified for use.  (2) In a network using subnets, the router that forwards traffic to a destination outside of the subnet of the transmitting device.

Defense_In_Depth
A security and antivirus term used to describe an approach to system  security where multiple layers of security are deployed to guard against failure of one component or layer.

Defrag
A DOS and Windows utility that defragments your hard disk. In Windows 95, you run Defrag by selecting Start->Programs->Accessories->System Tools->Disk Defragmenter.  See "Learn How to Defrag Your Hard Drive" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia. Also see "Tips to Fix a Slow Running Computer" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia. 

defragment
To optimize a disk by unfragmenting files. See under fragmentation.  

degauss
To remove magnetism from a device. The term is usually used in reference to color monitors and other display devices that use a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT). These devices aim electrons onto the display screen by creating magnetic fields inside the CRT. External magnetic forces -- such as the earth's natural magnetism or a magnet placed close to the monitor -- can magnetize the shadow mask, causing distorted images and colors.  To remove this external magnetic forces, most monitors automatically degauss the CRT whenever you turn on the monitor. In addition, many monitors have a manual degauss button that performs a more thorough degaussing of the CRT. You can also use an external degausser that degausses the monitor from the outside. Since it may be impossible to remove the external magnetic force, degaussing works by re-aligning the magnetic fields inside the CRT to compensate for the external magnetism.  You can also degauss magnetic media, such as disks, which removes all data from the media.  Also see Northern vs. Southern Hemisphere Monitors in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia. 

degrees_of_freedom
In biometrics it is a measurement used to determine how unique biometric data is.

del_icio_us
A social bookmarking Web site that serves as a bookmarks manager for users, similar to a collection of favorite links. You can add bookmarks to your del.icio.us list, categorize the bookmarks, tag them and also share them with others. On some blogs the words "del.icio.us" may appear below a blog post as a hyperlink that readers can click to submit the post to their del.icio.us bookmarks.

delete
To remove or erase. For example, deleting a character means removing it from a file or erasing it from the display screen. Deleting a file means erasing it from a disk. Note that, unlike cutting, deleting does not necessarily place the removed object in a buffer from where it can be recovered. Also see Are Deleted Files Completely Erased? in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia.  

Delete_key
Often abbreviated as Del, the Delete key is used to remove characters and other objects. On PCs, the Delete key generally removes the character immediately under the cursor (or to the right of the insertion point), or the highlighted text or object. Note the difference between the Delete key, which deletes the character under the cursor, and the Backspace key, which deletes the character to the left of the cursor or insertion point. On Macintoshes, the Delete key generally acts like a PC's Backspace key, deleting the character immediately in front of the insertion point.  

delimiter
A punctuation character or group of characters that separates two names or two pieces of data, or marks the beginning or end of a programming construct. Delimiters are used in almost every computer application. For example, in specifying DOS pathnames, the backslash (\) is the delimiter that separates directories and filenames. Other common delimiters include the comma (,), semicolon (;), quotes ("), and braces ({}).   

delisting
In search engine optimization (SEO) , delisting is the term used to  describe the removal of a Web page from a search engine index. Delisting  can happen for a number of reasons including spamdexing.

Dell_Computer
The world's largest mail-order computer vendor. Founded by Michael Dell in 1984, Dell Computer has built a reputation for delivering quality PCs at competitive prices. 

Delphi
A Rapid Application Development (RAD) system developed by Borland International, Inc. Delphi is similar to Visual Basic from Microsoft, but whereas Visual Basic is based on the BASIC programming language, Delphi is based on Pascal. 

delta_frame
In video compression technology, another name for a P-frame or a B-frame.

delta_point
)In biometrics and fingerprint scanning, the delta point is a pattern of a fingerprint that resembles the Greek letter delta. It's the point on a friction ridge at or nearest to the point of divergence of two type lines. See  "How Fingerprint Scanners Work" in the ""Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. See also  "How Biometrics Security Works" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. * Image Source: "See How Fingerprint Scanners Work"

demand_paging
In virtual memory systems, demand paging is a type of swapping in which pages of data are not copied from disk to RAM until they are needed. In contrast, some virtual memory systems use anticipatory paging, in which the operating system attempts to anticipate which data will be needed next and copies it to RAM before it is actually required.   

demarcation_point
Also called point of demarcation (POD), demarc extension, or demarc, it is the physical point at which the public network of a telecommunications company (i.e., a phone or cable company) ends and the private network of a customer begins - this is usually where the cable physically enters a building.
For example, if your business subscribes to receive Internet through a local phone or cable company, the provider installs a demarcation point at your business. The demarc is usually a grey box mounted on the outside of the building. On the outside of the building the provider's wires run in to the demarc (overhead or underground). The wires are switched at the Demarc and are then run into the physical building. For residential services, the demarc is often installed inside the residence in the homeowner's cellar or basement.

demultiplex
To separate two or more channels previously multiplexed. Demultiplexing is the reverse of multiplexing. 

DEN
Short for directory enabled network, a type of network that is managed from a central location. A DEN stores information about its users, network resources and applications in a database so that its operation can be managed from a central point by the network administrator. Any user that has an identification in the network can use any resource on the network as long as it has been predetermined that that user has the access privileges. For example, a student at a school can log on to any computer in the school��s network and access the resources that have been made available to him, such as applications, documents and network drives. Since access privileges are based on the individual and not the device, another person can subsequently sit at that same computer and using his identification and password have access to different resources than the person before him.

dendrimer
A synthetic, three-dimensional macromolecule formed using a nanoscale fabrication process. A dendrimer is built up from a monomer, with new branches added in steps until a tree-like structure is created (dendrimer comes from the Greek dendra, meaning tree). A dendrimer is technically a polymer.  In computer applications, early research suggests that dendrimers can be used to create ultra-low dielectric constant materials, which can lead to breakthroughs in semiconductor performance.

density
How tightly information is packed together on a storage medium (tape or disk). A higher density means that data are closer together, so the medium can hold more information. Floppy disks can be single-density, double-density, high-density, or extra-high-density. To use a double-density, high-density, or extra-high-density disk, you must have a disk drive that supports the density level. Density, therefore, can refer both to the media and the device.

DEP
Data Execution Prevention (DEP) helps prevent damage from viruses and other security threats that attack by running (executing) malicious code from memory locations that only Windows and other programs should use. This type of threat causes damage by taking over one or more memory locations in use by a program. Then it spreads and harms other programs, files and even your e-mail contacts. DEP monitors your programs to determine if they use system memory safely. To do this, DEP software works alone or with compatible microprocessors to mark some memory locations as "non-executable". If a program tries to run code, malicious or not, from a protected location, DEP closes the program and notifies you. DEP can take advantage of software and hardware support. To use DEP, your computer must be running Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) or later, or Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 or later.

deploy
(v.) To install, test and implement a computer system or application. The term can be used to refer to any installation and testing, such as setting up a new network in an enterprise, to installing a server farm, to implementing a new application over a distributed computing network.
The word deploy has roots as a military term, used to describe the placement of equipment and troops in a battlefield.

deprecated
(adj.) Used typically in reference to a computer language to mean a command or statement in the language that is going to be made invalid or obsolete in future versions. 

depth_of_field
Abbreviated as DOF, depth of field is a unit of measurement that represents the range of distances within an image where the focus is acceptably sharp.

derivative_work_right
The right to alter content, take extracts from it, combine it with another work, translate it into another language, or otherwise create a new work from an existing piece of content.

derived_class
A class that was created based on a previously existing class (i.e., base class). A derived class inherits all of the member variables and methods of the base class from which it is derived.  Also called a derived type.

derived_works
Derived or derivative works refers to any work that is based upon one or more existing works. In Open Source licensing, the license must allow modifications and derived works to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.See also derivative work right.

DES
Short for Data Encryption Standard, a popular symmetric-key encryption method developed in 1975 and standardized by ANSI in 1981 as ANSI X.3.92. DES uses a 56-bit key and uses the block cipher method, which breaks text into 64-bit blocks and then encrypts them. Also see Triple DES.

descender
In typography, the portion of a lowercase letter that falls below the baseline. In the English alphabet, 5 letters have descenders: g, j, p, q, and y.   

Deschutes
One of Intel's Pentium II microprocessor. Unlike previous Pentium IIs manufactured with a 0.35-micron process, the Deschutes processors have transistor sizes of 0.25 microns. The smaller size will enable Intel to produce smaller chips with lower power consumption. The first series of Deschutes chips ran at 333 MHz. 

design_win
The phrase used to describe a product that is incorporated into another company's sales model.

desk_accessory_DA
On Apple Macintoshes, a utility -- that is, a small, stand-alone program designed to perform one small task. For example, Apple's Calculator is a desk accessory.   

desknote
(n.) Also referred to as a desknote computer, a computer that physically is the size of a notebook computer but is designed to function as a stationary unit, like a desktop computer. Desknotes save space because of their compact size and are typically somewhat larger than a notebook or laptop computer, both in keyboard and monitor size, but are not designed to be portable. Desknotes do not have battery capacity and, while they are portable, cannot be used for mobile computing.  The name comes from combining desktop with notebook.

desktop
(1) In graphical user interfaces, a desktop is the metaphor used to portray file systems. Such a desktop consists of pictures, called icons, that show cabinets, files, folders, and various types of documents(that is, letters, reports, pictures). You can arrange the icons on the electronic desktop just as you can arrange real objects on a real desktop -- moving them around, putting one on top of another, reshuffling them, and throwing them away.
(2) Short for desktop model computer.


desktop_computer
(n.) A computer designed to fit comfortably on top of a desk, typically with the monitor sitting on top of the computer. Desktop model computers are broad and low, whereas tower model  computers are narrow and tall. Because of their shape, desktop model computers are generally limited to three internal mass storage devices. Desktop models designed to be very small are sometimes referred to as slimline models.


desktop_publishing
Using a personal computer or workstation to produce high-quality printed documents. A desktop publishing system allows you to use different typefaces, specify various margins and justifications, and embed illustrations and graphs directly into the text. The most powerful desktop publishing systems enable you to create illustrations, while less powerful systems let you insert illustrations created by other programs.
As word-processing programs become more and more powerful, the line separating such programs from desktop publishing systems is becoming blurred. In general, though, desktop publishing applications give you more control over typographical characteristics, such as kerning, and provide more support for full-color output.
A particularly important feature of desktop publishing systems is that they enable you to see on the display screen exactly how the document will appear when printed. Systems that support this feature are called WYSIWYGs (what you see is what you get).

desktop_virtualization
Desktop virtualization, often called client virtualization, is a virtualization technology used to separate a computer desktop environment from the physical computer. Desktop virtualization is considered a type of client-server computing model because the "virtualized" desktop is stored on a centralized, or remote, server and not the physical machine being virtualized.
Desktop virtualization "virtualizes desktop computers" and these virtual desktop environments are "served" to users on the network. You interact with a virtual desktop in the same way you would use a physical desktop. Another benefit of desktop virtualization is that is lets you remotely log in to access your desktop from any location.VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure -- or Interface) is a popular method of desktop virtualization. This type of desktop virtualization uses the server computing model, as the desktop virtualization in this scenario is enabled through hardware and software. VDI hosts the desktop environment in a virtual machine (VM) that runs on a centralized or remote server.

desktop-as-a-service_daas
Desktop-as-a-service (DaaS) is a form of virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) in which the VDI is outsourced and handled by a third party. Also called hosted desktop services, desktop-as-a-service is frequently delivered as a cloud service along with the apps needed for use on the virtual desktop.
A Desktop-as-a-service provider typically handles storing, securing and backing up a user's data, as well as upgrades for the DaaS service and supported applications. Some of the more well-known desktop-as-a-service providers include Amazon, Desktone (a VMware company) and Citrix.

destination
Many computer commands move data from one file to another or from one storage device to another. This is referred to as moving the data from the source to the destination (or target). The term is also used as an adjective, as in destination file  or destination device .   

Destructive_Trojan
A type of Trojan horse designed to destroy and delete files, and is more like a virus than any other Trojan. It can often go undetected by antivirus software.See also Trojan horse.

detachable-touchscreen
Detachable screen (or detachable touchscreen) is a phrase commonly associated with laptop-tablet hybrid devices, also called a convertible laptop. The device is typically a fully-featured tablet, which is connected to a docking device to provide users with a full keyboard. When connected, the tablet becomes the "screen" of the laptop. Users can disconnect the keyboard to use the device as a touchscreen tablet. The devices may be sold as a tablet or advertised as a laptop with detachable screen or convertible laptop. 
See related term phablet.

deterministic_system
A system in which the output can be predicted with 100 percent certainty.  Contrast with nondeterministic system.

device
Any machine or component that attaches to a computer. Examples of devices include disk drives, printers, mice, and modems. These particular devices fall into the category of peripheral devicesbecause they are separate from the main computer.
Most devices, whether peripheral or not, require a program called a device driver that acts as a translator, converting general commands from an application into specific commands that the device understands.


Device_Bay
A specification developed by Intel, Compaq and Microsoft that would standardize the size, shape, and connection of computer components, such as disk drives, modems, and audio devices. This would enable computer owners to easily exchange and upgrade these components. The Device Bay specification is similar to the PCMCIA standard, but is designed for larger, faster devices. Device Bay components would connect to a computer using either the USB or IEEE 1394 (FireWire) interfaces.  Although the original specification was worked out in early 1997, computer manufacturers have not yet adopted it. Some analysts expect the first computers supporting Device Bay to appear sometime in 1999.  

device_manager
Device Manager is an OS feature that lets you view and change the properties of all devices attached to your computer.
To get to the device manager in Windows, right click on the My computer icon, choose properties, then click on the device manager tab. From there you can select a variety of management options.
The device manager is found in both Windows (95 and higher) and Macintosh PC platforms. Windows2000 contains an improved device manager that detects plug-and-play hardwareand displays a large list of supported hardware.

Device_Software_Optimization
Device Software Optimization (DSO) is a methodology that enables companies to develop and run multiple device software at a faster more reliable rate and at a lower cost. DSO encompasses enterprise-wide development processes and benefits include a standardization of technologies, tools and processes, reuse of intellectual property, and a broad ecosystem of hardware and software partners. [Adapted from the Wind River Web site]

device_dependent
(adj.) Like machine-dependent, device-dependent refers to programs that can run only on a certain type of hardware (i.e., their ability to function depends on the devices on which they run).  

Devicescape
The corporate name of a Wi-Fi software solution provider, headquartered in San Bruno, California. Devicescape offers Wi-Fi solutions that are designed to effortlessly connect to any Wi-Fi network. One product, Easy Wi-Fi, is a solution that makes Wi-Fi  devices easy to set up, easy to use, compatible with any Wi-Fi network, and usable all over the world. The product is targeted to device manufacturers. For Wi-Fi users, the company's Easy Wi-Fi provides instant access to hotspots all over the World.

devops_development_operations
DevOps (development and operations) is an enterprise software development phrase used to mean a type of agile relationship between Development and IT Operations. The goal of DevOps is to change and improve the relationship by advocating better communication and collaboration between the two business units.


DHA
Short for Directory Harvest Attack, DHA is a type of malicious Internet attack where online spammers collect valid e-mail address and target those addresses in a spam attack or sell the lists of valid e-mail addresses to unscrupulous marketers. In a DHA attack, the spammer will select a domain name, for example, Webopedia.com. The spammer then sends an e-mail to any possible addresses within that domain name. If the e-mail server doe not reject the e-mail, the spammer knows it is a valid e-mail address and adds it to his target list. See grabber. See also "Getting Rid of Spam" and "All About Spam, Spim and Spit" in the Did You Know section of Webopedia.

DHCP
Short for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, a protocol for assigning dynamic IP addresses to devices on a network. With dynamic addressing, a device can have a different IP address every time it connects to the network. In some systems, the device's IP address can even change while it is still connected. DHCP also supports a mix of static and dynamic IP addresses.
DHCP Simplifies Network Administration
Dynamic addressing simplifies network administration because the software keeps track of IP addresses rather than requiring an administrator to manage the task. This means that a new computer can be added to a network without the hassle of manually assigning it a unique IP address. Many ISPs use dynamic IP addressing for Internet subscribers.

DHCP_Server_Settings
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration  Protocol) Server Settings are commonly found on broadband router firmware. The DHCP section is where you can configure the router's built-in DHCP Server to assign IP addresses to the computers and other devices on your local area network (LAN). Other DHCP options include Enable DHCP Server and Add or Edit DHCP Reservation. See "Common Router Settings" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia. See also Webopedia's "Did You Know... Routers, Switches and Hubs: What's the Difference?"

Dhrystone
Developed in 1984 by R.P. Wecker, Dhrystone is a benchmark program written in C or Pascal (and now even in Java) that tests a system's integer performance. The program is CPU bound, performing no I/O functions or operating system calls.   Dhrystones per second is the metric used to measure the number of times the program can run in a second.  

dial_peer
An addressable call endpoint - a software structure that binds a dialed digit string to a voice port or IP address of the destination gateway. Several dial peers always exist on each router in the network, and at least two dial peers will be involved in making a call across the network, one on the originating end and one on the terminating end. In Voice over IP, there are two kinds of dial peers: POTS and VoIP. VoIP peers point to specific VoIP devices.

dial_peer_hunting
Dial peer hunting is the process used when an originating router tries to establish a call on different dial peers if the originating router receives a user-busy invalid number or an unassigned-number disconnect cause code from a destination router. See also dial peer.

dial_up_access
Refers to connecting a device to a network via a modem and a public telephone network. Dial-up access is really just like a phone connection, except that the parties at the two ends are computer devices rather than people. Because dial-up access uses normal telephone lines, the quality of the connection is not always good and data rates are limited. In the past, the maximum data rate with dial-up access was 56 Kbps (56,000 bits per second), but new technologies such as ISDN are providing faster rates.
An alternative way to connect two computers is through a leased line, which is a permanent connection between two devices. Leased lines provide faster throughputand better quality connections, but they are also more expensive.
Also see Dial-Up Modem Standards in the Quick Referencesection of Webopedia.

Dial_Up_Networking
A component in Windows 95 (and Windows 98) that enables you to connect your computer to a network via a modem. If your computer is not connected to a LAN and you want to connect to the Internet, you need to configure Dial-Up Networking (DUN) to dial a Point of Presence (POP) and log into your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Your ISP will need to provide certain information, such as the gateway address and your computer's IP address.  You access DUN through the My Computer icon. You can configure a different profile (called a connectoid) for each different online service you use. Once configured, you can copy a connectoid shortcut to your desktop so that all you need to do to make a connection is double-click the connectoid icon.  

dialer
A program that is often used to maliciously redirect  Internet connections. When used in a malicious way, it disconnects the legitimate telephone connection used to connect to the Internet and re-connects via a premium rate number (1-900 numbers). Often, the first indication a user has of this activity is an extremely expensive phone bill, as the victim (account holder) is being charged for the amount of time connected to the premium rate number. Malicious dialer programs are a type of spyware that can install itself to your dial-up settings. [Adapted from Panda Software]

dialog_box
)A box that appears on a display screen to present information or request input. Typically, dialog boxes are temporary -- they disappear once you have entered the requested information.
In the Macintosh and Microsoft Windows interfaces, there is a convention that any menu option followed by ellipsis points (... ) will, when selected, bring up a dialog box. Options without ellipsis points are executed directly.


DIB
(1) Short for Dual Independent Bus, a bus architecture that is part of Intel's Pentium Pro and Pentium II microprocessors. As its name implies, DIB uses two buses: one from the processor to main memory, and the other from the processor to the L2 cache. The processor can access both buses simultaneously, which increases throughput.  (2) Short for device-independent bitmap, the bit-mapped graphics format used by Windows. Graphics stored in DIB format generally end with a .bmp extension. It's called device-independent because colors are represented in a format independent of the final output device. When a DIB image is output (to a monitor or printer), the device driver translates the DIB colors into actual colors that the output device can display.  

DICOM
Short for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine, a standard in the field of medical informatics for exchanging digital information between medical imaging equipment (such as radiological imaging) and other systems, ensuring interoperability. The standard specifies:  a set of protocols for devices communicating over a network the syntax and semantics of commands and associated information that can be exchanged using these protocols a set of media storage services and devices claiming conformance to the standard, as well as a file format and a medical directory structure to facilitate access to the images and related information stored on media that share information.   The standard was developed jointly by ACR (the American College of Radiology) and NEMA (the National Electrical Manufacturers Association) as an extension to an earlier standard for exchanging medical imaging data that did not include provisions for networking or offline media formats.

dictionary_attack
(n.) (1) A method used to break security systems, specifically password-based security systems, in which the attacker systematically tests all possible passwords beginning with words that have a higher possibility of being used, such as names and places. The word "dictionary" refers to the attacker exhausting all of the words in a dictionary in an attempt to discover the password. Dictionary attacks are typically done with software instead of an individual manually trying each password.  (2) An e-mail spamming technique in which the spammer sends out thousands or millions of e-mails with randomly generated addresses using combinations of letters added to known domain names in the hopes of reaching a percentage of actual e-mail addresses. For example, a dictionary attack list might begin with john@webopedia.com, john1@webopedia.com, john2@webopedia.com, and so on until all possible combinations of letters and numbers has been exhausted.

DID
Short for direct inward dialing (also known as direct dialing inward), a service of an LEC or local phone company that allows an organization to have numerous individual phone numbers for each person or workstation in its PBXsystem that run off of a small block of dedicated telephone numbers. DID allows the multiple lines to be connected to the PBX all at once without requiring each to have a physical line connecting to the PBX.
For example, if an organization has 25 employees and each employee has a separate telephone number, or extension, within its physical location, the organization can rent 10 physical trunk lines from the telephone company that will allow 10 phone calls to take place simultaneously. Others would have to wait for an available line and anyone dialing into the system while all 10 lines are in use would get either a busy signal or be channeled into a voice mail system. A DID system does not require a PBX operator and can be used for fax and voice transmissions.

die
(plural dies or dice) A square of silicon that contains an integrated circuit.  Die often is used synonymously with chip.

dielectric
(adj.) Refers to a material that is a poor conductor of electricity. Dielectric materials can be made to hold an electrostatic charge while dissipating minimal energy in the form of heat. Glass, porcelain, mica, rubber, plastics dry air, vacuums and some liquids and gases are dielectric.

difference_score
The value returned by a biometric engine that indicates the degree of difference found between a reference biometric sample (e.g. the data on file) and the data being obtained for comparison. See "Defend Yourself Against Identity Theft" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. See also "How Biometrics Security Works" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. Also see "How Fingerprint Scanners Work" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia.

differential_incremental_backup
The backup of all data files that have been modified since the last incremental backup or archival backup.  Compare with cumulative incremental backup.

Digg
A community-based Web site where users submit content and rate that content by "Digging" what they see and like best. A submission that earns a larger number of Diggs, and therefore is more popular with users, is moved the Digg homepage for the category of content it belongs in. The Digg Web site was founded by Kevin Rose and launched in November 2004.

Digg_This
On many blogs including Typepad, Blogger, Live Journal, Moveable Type, and Wordpress, the words "Digg This" may appear below a blog post as a hyperlink which readers can click to submit the post to the Digg Web site.

diginotar
A Dutch Certificate Authority (CA) that issues SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and EVSSL (Extended Validation) certificates, which help to ensure the websites visited by users when Web browsing are authentic rather than fake websites masquerading as legitimate sites. In July 2011, DigiNotar was hacked by a certificate bandit, which was able to issue fraudulent certificates through the company for a fake Google web site as well as several dozen other sites.
As a certificate authority, DigiNotar plays a critical role in data security and electronic commerce by providing an independent "trusted third party" guarantee that the website and the person interacting and exchanging information with the website are really who they claim to be. Following DigiNotar's issuance of fraudulent certificates in 2011, Google, Mozilla and Microsoft all revoked the company's authority to vouch for its certificates as a trusted third party, and in September of 2011 the Dutch government announced that it would be switching to a different certification authority.

digital
(adj.) Describes any system based on discontinuous data or events. Computers are digital machines because at their most basic level they can distinguish between just two values, 0 and 1, or off and on. There is no simple way to represent all the values in between, such as 0.25. All data that a computer processes must be encoded digitally, as a series of zeroes and ones.
The opposite of digital is analog. A typical analog device is a clock in which the hands move continuously around the face. Such a clock is capable of indicating every possible time of day. In contrast, a digital clock is capable of representing only a finite number of times (every tenth of a second, for example).
In general, humans experience the world analogically. Vision, for example, is an analog experience because we perceive infinitely smooth gradations of shapes and colors. Most analog events, however, can be simulated digitally. Photographs in newspapers, for instance, consist of an array of dots that are either black or white. From afar, the viewer does not see the dots (the digital form), but only lines and shading, which appear to be continuous. Although digital representations are approximations of analog events, they are useful because they are relatively easy to store and manipulate electronically. The trick is in converting from analog to digital, and back again.

digital_access_and_cross-connect_system
A digital switching device in telecommunications for routing T1 lines. The DACS can cross-connect any T1 line in the system with any other T1 line also in the system. DACS can also connect any DS-0 channel or group of channels on a T1 line to any DS-0 time slots of any other line. 

digital_advertising
Digital advertising is also called Internet marketing.
Digital advertising, also called Internet advertising ("Internet marketing") is when businesses leverage Internet technologies to deliver promotional advertisements to consumers. Digital advertising includes promotional advertisements and messages delivered through email, social media websites, online advertising on search engines, banner ads on mobile or Web sites and affiliates programs.
See "Small Business Marketing - Free Internet Marketing Tools & Strategies" on Webopedia.

Digital_AMPS
Also abbreviated as D-AMPS, Digital AMPS, which is short for Digital Advanced Mobile Phone Service, is a wireless standard used in the United States and other countries. D-AMPS uses digital TDMA and operates on the 800 and 1900 MHz bands. D-AMPS is the digital version of the analog cellular phone service standard, AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone Service).

digital_artifact
In digital photography and digital video an artifact refers to any visible defect. Jaggies is considered to be a type of digital artifact, and image compression may also introduce artifacts into a digital image.

digital_audio
Refers to the reproduction and transmission of sound stored in a digital format. This includes CDs as well as any sound files stored on a computer. In contrast, the telephone system (but not ISDN) is based on an analog representation of sound. In sound recording and reproduction systems, digital audio refers to a digital representation of the audio waveform for processing, storage or transmission. When analog sound waves are stored in digital form, each digital audio file can be decomposed into a series of samples.

digital_camera
A camera that stores images digitally rather than recording them on film. Once a picture has been taken, it can be downloaded to a computer system, and then manipulated with a graphics  program and printed. Unlike film photographs, which have an almost infinite resolution, digital photos are limited by the amount of memory in the camera, the optical resolution of the digitizing mechanism, and, finally, by the resolution of the final output device. Even the best digital cameras connected to the best printers cannot produce film-quality photos. However, if the final output device is a laser printer, it doesn't really matter whether you take a real photo and then scanit, or take a digital photo. In both cases, the image must eventually be reduced to the resolution of the printer.
The big advantage of digital cameras is that making photos is both inexpensive and fast because there is no film processing. Interestingly, one of the biggest boosters of digital photography is Kodak, the largest producer of film. Kodak developed the Kodak PhotoCD format, which has become the de facto standardfor storing digital photographs.
Most digital cameras use CCDs to capture images, though some of the newer less expensive cameras use CMOSchips instead.

digital_cash
A system that allows a person to pay for goods or services by transmitting a number from one computer to another. Like the serial numbers on real dollar bills, the digital cash numbers are unique. Each one is issued by a bank and represents a specified sum of real money. One of the key features of digital cash is that, like real cash, it is anonymous and reusable. That is, when a digital cash amount is sent from a buyer to a vendor, there is no way to obtain information about the buyer. This is one of the key differences between digital cash and credit card systems. Another key difference is that a digital cash certificate can be reused.  Digital cash transactions are expected to become commonplace by the year 2000. However, there a number of competing protocols, and it is unclear which ones will become dominant. Most digital cash systems start with a participating bank that issues cash numbers or other unique identifiers that carry a given value, such as five dollars. To obtain such a certificate, you must have an account at the bank; when you purchase digital cash certificates, the money is withdrawn from your account. You transfer the certificate to the vendor to pay for a product or service, and the vendor deposits the cash number in any participating bank or retransmits it to another vendor. For large purchases, the vendor can check the validity of a cash number by contacting the issuing bank.  

digital_certificate
An attachment to an electronic message used for security purposes. The most common use of a digital certificate is to verify that a user sending a message is who he or she claims to be, and to provide the receiver with the means to encode a reply.
An individual wishing to send an encrypted message applies for a digital certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA). The CA issues an encrypted digital certificate containing the applicant's public key and a variety of other identification information. The CA makes its own public key readily available through print publicity or perhaps on the Internet.
The recipient of an encrypted message uses the CA's public key to decode the digital certificate attached to the message, verifies it as issued by the CA and then obtains the sender's public key and identification information held within the certificate. With this information, the recipient can send an encrypted reply.

Digital_City
Commonly called a City Guide, Digital City refers to a locally focused online network, which delivers local (city-based) content such as community events, nightlife, localized yellow pages, entertainment, visitor's guide, and e-commerce. Some may be considered a Web portal.

digital_divide
A term used to describe the discrepancy between people who have access to and the resources to use new information and communication tools, such as the Internet, and people who do not have the resources and access to the technology. The term also describes the discrepancy between those who have the skills, knowledge and abilities to use the technologies and those who do not. The digital divide can exist between those living in rural areas and those living in urban areas, between the educated and uneducated, between economic classes, and on a global scale between more and less industrially developed nations.

digital_duplicates
The term used to describe reproductions of an image where the original is scanned and saved in a digital format. From this digital format the file can be reproduced through printing or other recording methods.See also "The Digital Camera Picture" in Webopedia's Quick Reference section. 

digital_envelope
A type of security that uses two layers of encryption to protect a message. First, the message itself is encoded using symmetric encryption, and then the key to decode the message is encrypted using public-key encryption. This technique overcomes one of the problems of public-key encryption, which is that it is slower than symmetric encryption. Because only the key is protected with public-key encryption, there is very little overhead.  

digital_footprint
On the Internet a digital footprint is the word used to describe the trail, traces or "footprints" that people leave online. This is information transmitted online, such as forum registration, e-mails and attachments, uploading videos or digital images and any other form of transmission of information — all of which leaves traces of personal information about yourself available to others online.

digital_goods
In electronic commerce, digital goods is a general term that is used to describe any goods that are stored, delivered and used in its electronic format. Digital goods are shipped electronically to the consumer through e-mail or download from the Internet. Usually when you purchase digital goods online, after payment has been received the merchant will provide you with your digital item as an e-mail attachment or they may provide you with a secure link where you can download the item.   Examples of digital goods include e-books, music files, software, digital images, Web site templates, manuals in electronic format, and any item which can be electronically stored in a file or multiple files.   Digital goods may also be called electronic goods or e-goods. See also Three-for-All: Affordable Selling Services for Digital Goods on E-commerceGuide.com.

digital_home
As defined by the DLNA, the term digital home refers to a home network of CE, mobile and PC devices that cooperate transparently, delivering simple, seamless interoperability that enhances and enriches user experiences.

digital_ink
Refers to technology that digitally represents handwriting in its natural form. In a typical digital ink system, a digitizer is laid under or over an LCD screen to create an electromagnetic field that can capture the movement of a special-purpose pen, or stylus, and record the movement on the LCD screen. The effect is like writing on paper with liquid ink. The recorded handwriting can then be saved as handwriting or converted to typewritten text using handwriting recognition technology.

Digital_Living_Network_Alliance
The Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) group work towards a vision of a wired and wireless interoperable network of Personal Computers (PC), Consumer Electronics (CE) and mobile devices in the home, enabling a seamless environment for sharing and growing new digital media and content services. [Source: Adapted from DLNA Web site] 

digital_loop_carrier
(dij´i-t&l loop kar´ē-&r) (n.) Abbreviated as DLC, a system for transmitting digital multiplexed data signals using existing cabling for distribution. The digital loop carrier begins the transmission at the central office on a high-speed digital line, such as T1, and routes the transmission to a remote digital terminal, which then converts the signal into a form that can be passed on to low-speed lines for routing to the end users telephone or computer. The process is reversed when transmissions are sent from the end user, where the system collects transmissions and multiplexes them so they can be sent in the aggregate to the central office of the local loop.

digital_mapping
The process of storing and displaying map data in digital form (to store and retrieve on a computer).

Digital_Media_Boost
Abbreviated as DMB, an Intel technology that is used to improve thread synchronization to enhance intensive PC gaming. Intel Advanced Digital Media Boost enables 128-bit instructions to be executed at 1 per clock cycle, which effectively doubles the speed of execution.

digital_monitor
A monitor that accepts digital rather than analog signals. All monitors (except flat-panel displays) use CRT technology, which is essentially analog. The term digital, therefore, refers only to the type of input received from the video adapter. A digital monitor then translates the digital signals into analog signals that control the actual display.  Although digital monitors are fast and produce clear images, they cannot display continuously variable colors. Consequently, only low-quality video standards, such as MDA , CGA , and EGA , specify digital signals. VGA and SVGA, on the other hand, require an analog monitor. Some monitors are capable of accepting either analog or digital signals.   

Digital_Negative
Abbreviated as DNG, Digital Negative is a type of container format that was designed by Adobe to hold raw digital camera files, including proprietary raw files, and its associated information, like metadata in an XMP format.

digital_phone
Digital phone services are offered through local phone companies, cable companies and broadband Internet service providers, typically as part of a bundled package with cable television, high-speed Internet access and in some cases cellular telephone service.  The digital phone services offered by these providers are actually just re-branded Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, Internet phone services.
Prices for digital telephone service tend to be higher than that of pure VoIP   services, with the cost difference typically justified by higher voice quality,   the established reputation of digital phone service providers, and the convenience   in having multiple services offered and billed by one provider.  See "The Difference Between VoIP and PSTN Systems" in the Did You Know... section of Webopedia.
Also see the VoIP Meets WiFi article in the Did You Know? section of Webopedia.

digital_photo_effects
Many graphics and image-editing programs offer image effects specifically for digital photos. These types of effects are used to remove problems that can appear in your original digital photograph such as various lens corrections (pincushion or fisheye) and red-eye removal tools.  See also "Graphics Software Terminology" in the  Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

digital_photography
Digital photography is the art and science of producing and manipulating digital photographs — photographs that are represented as bit maps. Digital photographs can be produced in a number of ways:

Directly with a digital camera
By capturing a frame from a video
By scanning a conventional photograph

Once a photograph is in digital format, you can apply a wide variety of special effects to it with image enhancing software. You can then print the photo out on a normal printer or send it to a developing studio which will print it out on photographic paper.
Although the resolution of digital photos is not nearly as high as photos produced from film, digital photography is ideal when you need instant, low-resolution pictures. It's especially useful for photos that will be displayed on the World Wide Web because Web graphics need to be low resolution anyway so that they can be downloaded quickly.

digital_satellite_system
Abbreviated DSS, a network of satellites that broadcast digital data. An example of a DSS is DirecTV, which broadcasts digital television signals. DSS's are expected to become more important as the TV and computer converge into a single medium for information and entertainment. 

digital_signature
A digital code that can be attached to an electronically transmitted message that uniquely identifies the sender. Like a written signature, the purpose of a digital signature is to guarantee that the individual sending the message really is who he or she claims to be. Digital signatures are especially important for electronic commerce and are a key component of most authentication schemes. To be effective, digital signatures must be unforgeable. There are a number of different encryption techniques to guarantee this level of security.  

digital_video
Refers to the capturing, manipulation and storage of video in digital formats. A digital video (DV) camcorder, for example, is a video camera that captures and stores images on a digital medium such as a DAT.   

digital_video_surveillance_system
An appliance that enables embedded image capture capabilities that allows video images or extracted information to be compressed, stored or transmitted over communication networks or digital data link. Digital video surveillance systems are used for any type of monitoring.

digital_wallet
(1) Encryption software that works like a physical wallet during electronic commerce transactions. A wallet can hold a user's payment information, a digital certificate to identify the user, and shipping information to speed transactions. The consumer benefits because his or her information is encrypted against piracy and because some wallets will automatically input shipping information at the merchant's site and will give the consumer the option of paying by digital cash or check. Merchants benefit by receiving protection against fraud.   Most wallets reside on the user's PC, but recent versions, called "thin" wallets, are placed on the credit card issuer's server. Netscape and Microsoft now support wallet technology on their browsers.  (2) Digital Wallet, a registered trademark of Minds@Work, is a self-powered portable hard drive used for storing digital camera images.

digital_watermark
Also referred to as simply watermarking, a pattern of bits inserted into a digital image, audio or video file that identifies the file's copyright information (author, rights, etc.). The name comes from the faintly visible watermarks imprinted on stationery that identify the manufacturer of the stationery. The purpose of digital watermarks is to provide copyright protection for intellectual property that's in digital format.  Unlike printed watermarks, which are intended to be somewhat visible, digital watermarks are designed to be completely invisible, or in the case of audio clips, inaudible. Moreover, the actual bits representing the watermark must be scattered throughout the file in such a way that they cannot be identified and manipulated. And finally, the digital watermark must be robust enough so that it can withstand normal changes to the file, such as reductions from lossy compression algorithms.  Satisfying all these requirements is no easy feat, but there are a number of companies offering competing technologies. All of them work by making the watermark appear as noise - that is, random data that exists in most digital files anyway. To view a watermark, you need a special program that knows how to extract the watermark data.  Watermarking is also called data embedding and information hiding. See also  Graphics Software Terminology in Webopedia's Quick Reference Area. 

digital_zoom
Digital zoom is a function of a digital camera used to make the image seem more close-up. Digital zoom on a digital camera works the same as cropping and enlarging a photo in a graphics program. This type of zoom will result in a loss of quality and image resolution because the image is simply being enlarged without any extra details or pixels being added. Due to the quality of photos taken when using the digital zoom function, these photos may not be of good enough quality to print images larger than 4"x6".

digital_to_analog_converter
Short for digital-to-analog converter, a device (usually a single chip) that converts digital data into analog signals. Modems require a DAC to convert data to analog signals that can be carried by telephone wires. Video adapters also require DACs, called RAMDACs, to convert digital data to analog signals that the monitor can process. 

Digital8
Abbreviated as D8, a recording format that uses  digital video (DV) compression to store data digitally on 8mm tape. It was marketed by Sony in the late '90s and is its proprietary digital camcorder format.

digitize
To translate into a digital form. For example, optical scanners digitize images by translating them into bit maps. It is also possible to digitize sound, video, and any type of movement. In all these cases, digitization is performed by sampling at discrete intervals. To digitize sound, for example, a device measures a sound wave's amplitude many times per second. These numeric values can then be recorded digitally. 

digitizing_tablet
An input device that enables you to enter drawings and sketches into a computer. A digitizing tablet consists of an electronic tablet and a cursor or pen. A cursor (also called a puck) is similar to a mouse, except that it has a window with cross hairs for pinpoint placement, and it can have as many as 16 buttons. A pen (also called a stylus) looks like a simple ballpoint pen but uses an electronic head instead of ink. The tablet contains electronics that enable it to detect movement of the cursor or pen and translate the movements into digital signals that it sends to the computer.  For digitizing tablets, each point on the tablet represents a point on the display screen in a fixed manner. This differs from mice, in which all movement is relative to the current cursor position. The static nature of digitizing tablets makes them particularly effective for tracing drawings. Most modern digitizing tablets also support a mouse  emulation   mode , in which the pen or cursor acts like a mouse.  Digitizing tablets are also called digitizers, graphics tablets, touch tablets, or simply tablets.   

DIIOP
Short for Dominio Internet Inter-Orb Protocol it allows external programs to attach to, and manipulate Domino databases. DIIOP is frequently used to allow Java-based and other non  CORBA programs to connect to Lotus Domino.

dilberted
Slang term used to mean a person who has been exploited, oppressed or otherwise treated badly by their boss in their workplace. This slang word is derived from the fictional character, named Dilbert, from the comic strip of the same name. Dilbert, which was first published in April 1989, is written and drawn by Scott Adams.

DIMM
Short for dual in-line memory module, a small circuit board that holds memory chips. A single in-line memory module (SIMM) has a 32-bit path to the memory chips whereas a DIMM has 64-bit path. Because the Pentium processorrequires a 64-bit path to memory, you need to install SIMMs two at a time. With DIMMs, you can install memory one DIMM at a time.


DIN_connector
)DIN is short for Deutsches Insitut f��r Normung eV, the standards -setting organization for Germany. A DIN connector is a connector that conforms to one of the many standards defined by DIN. DIN connectors are used widely in personal computers. For example, the keyboard connector for PCs is a DIN connector.  DIN 41612 connectors are used widely to connect network equipment, such as routers and switches. 

dingbat
)A small picture, such as a star or a pointing finger, that can be inserted into a document. Many sets of dingbats are available as a special font. One of the most popular is Zapf dingbats, named after its creator, Hermann Zapf.  

diode
An electric component that conducts electric current in only one direction, functioning as a one-way valve. Diodes typically are made from semiconductor materials such as silicon, germanium or selenium and are uses as voltage regulators, signal rectifiers, oscillators and signal modulators/demodulators.  In computer equipment, diodes are commonly used to emit light by passing a current through it, as in light emitting diodes (LEDs).

diopter
On a digital camera, a diopter is a small dial or knob adjuster connected to the viewfinder. The diopter allows you to adjust the viewfinder sharpness to match your own eyesight. The diopter adjustment controls the focus of the viewfinder only, it does not change the focus of the camera lens.

DIP
)Acronym for dual in-line package, a type of chip housed in a rectangular casing with two rows of connecting pins on either side.   

DIP_switch
)A series of tiny switches built into circuit boards. The housing for the switches, which has the same shape as a chip, is the DIP.  DIP switches enable you to configure a circuit board for a particular type of computer or application. The installation instructions should tell you how to set the switches. DIP switches are always toggle switches, which means they have two possible positions -- on or off. (Instead of on and off, you may see the numbers 1 and 0.)  One of the historic advantages of the Macintosh over the PC was that it allowed you to configure circuit boards by entering software commands instead of setting DIP switches. However, the new Plug & Play standard developed by Microsoft makes DIP switches obsolete for PC expansion cards too.  

dipole_antenna
An antenna that has  omnidirectional coverage. Access Points usually have one or more dipole antennas.

DirecPC
A service offered by Hughes Network Systems that provides Internet access through private satellite dishes. Requests for Web pages go through a normal modem connection but pages are delivered through the satellite link at up to 400 Kbps (about 15 times faster than a 28.8 Kbps modem, and 4 times faster than an ISDN connection).  To install the DirecPC system, you need to purchase a small satellite dish from Hughes, plus an ISA card to install in your computer. You'll also need a normal Internet connection via an ISP for upstream traffic (e.g., requests for Web pages).   

direct_broadcasting_satellite
Abbreviated as DBS, a direct broadcasting satellite is a type of satellite used for consumer services such as the transmission of radio and television programs. A direct broadcasting satellite is similar to a fixed service satellite (FSS) however it offers a higher power output requiring smaller  antennas for receiving the signal.

direct_digital_marketing
Direct digital marketing is digital marketing method that is addressable-meaning you can identify the recipient of the marketing message being distributed. Traditional direct marketing is achieved using a customer's postal address and sending physical paper mail, such as a flyer or brochure. With the evolution of direct marketing to direct digital marketing, addressability comes in a variety of digital forms including an e-mail address, a Web browser cookie, or a mobile phone number.

direct_fingerprint_reader
Abbreviated as DFR (and also called a fingerprint scanner or fingerprint reader) a direct fingerprint reader is a biometrics device that uses automated methods of recognizing a person based on unique physical characteristics of a person's fingerprint. A fingerprint is made up of a pattern of ridges and furrows as well as characteristics that occur at minutiae points (ridge bifurcation or a ridge ending). Fingerprint scanning essentially provides an identification of a person based on the acquisition and recognition (or verification) of those unique patterns and ridges in a fingerprint.
 
Fingerprint devices are by far the most popular form of biometric security used, with a variety of systems on the market intended for general and mass market usage.  See  "How Fingerprint Scanners Work" in the ""Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. See also  "How Biometrics Security Works" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia.

direct_memory_execute
Direct Memory Execute (Abbreviated as DIME; also called AGP texturing) is an important feature of AGP. It allows video cards to access your systems main memory for texture mapping rather than pre-loading the texture data to the graphics card's memory.See Also AGP , and Video memory.

direct_photo_printing
A technology found on printers, especially photo printers which enables users to use the memory card in their digital camera right in the printer to print without transferring the images to a computer. Photo printers usually have multiple slots to accept different types of memory cards.See also PictBridge.

Direct_Web_Remoting
Direct Web Remoting (DWR) is a Java open source library for those wanting to develop Web sites which contain Ajax. DWR enables the Javascript in a browser to interact with Java on a server, just as if it were in the browser. DWR encompasses two main components; a Java Servlet running on the server that processes requests and sends responses back to the browser, and JavaScript running in the browser that sends requests and can dynamically update the Web page. DWR development is sponsored by TIBCO.

direct_connect_modem
A modem that connects directly to a telephone line via modular connectors rather than requiring an acoustic coupler. Almost all modern modems are direct-connect.  

direct_view_tv
A direct view television is the type of television we all are familiar with, it's been around for many years. Direct-view televisions use a CRT and a scanning electronic gun to "paint" an image on a phosphor coated screen. Direct-view televisions are now, however, available in analog, digital and HDTV versions. For digital TV, direct view displays are basically traditional color televisions which are updated for digital TV broadcasting.

Direct3D
An API for manipulating and displaying three-dimensional objects. Developed by Microsoft, Direct3D provides programmers with a way to develop 3-D programs that can utilize whatever graphics acceleration device is installed in the machine. Virtually all 3-D accelerator cards for PCs support Direct3D.  Another 3-D standard offering similar functionality is OpenGL.  

DirectDraw
A software interface standard for transferring video processing from a PC's CPU to the video adapter. The standard was first developed by Intel and called the Display Control Interface (DCI) and is now supported by Microsoft with the name DirectDraw as a registered trademark.  When the CPU is not busy, the Windows Graphics Display Interface (GDI) updates the video display. If the CPU is busy, the DCI driver allows an application to send update information directly to the video adapter. DirectDraw can also provide applications such as games direct access to features of particular display devices.  

directory
)(1) An organizational unit, or container, used to organize folders and files into a hierarchical structure. Directories contain bookkeeping information about files that are, figuratively speaking, beneath them in the hierarchy. You can think of a directory as a file cabinet that contains folders that contain files. Many graphical user interfaces use the term folder instead of directory.
Computer manuals often describe directories and file structures in terms of an inverted tree. The files and directories at any level are contained in the directory above them. To access a file, you may need to specify the names of all the directories above it. You do this by specifying a path.
The topmost directory in any file is called the root directory. A directory that is below another directory is called a subdirectory. A directory above a subdirectory is called the parent directory. Under DOS and Windows, the root directory is a back slash (\).

directory_service
A network service that identifies all resources on a network and makes them accessible to users and applications. Resources include e-mail addresses, computers, and peripheral devices such as printers. Ideally, the directory service should make the physical network topology and protocols transparent so that a user on a network can access any resource without knowing where or how it is physically connected.  There are a number of directory services that are used widely. Two of the most important ones are LDAP, which is used primarily for e-mail addresses, and Netware Directory Service (NDS), which is used on Novell Netware networks. Virtually all directory services are based on the X.500 ITU standard, although the standard is so large and complex that no vendor complies with it fully. 

DirectPlay
Intended for computer game development, Microsoft DirectPlay is a media-independent networking API that provides networking services at the transport protocol and session protocol levels. *DirectPlay's media independence means that DirectPlay sessions can be run on TCP/IP networks, IPX networks, and over directly connected modems and serial cables. DirectPlay's media independence also allows it to be extended in the future to support new standards and protocols as they become widely deployed. Also included in DirectPlay are the DirectPlay Lobby APIs, which allow applications to register themselves with DirectPlay so that other applications can easily launch them and pass them network addressing information. This allows you to write games that can be immediately launched by a number of different matchmaking services and utilities, without having to write special code for each launcher.  * [Source: MS Knowledgebase]

DirectX
A set of APIs developed by Microsoft that enables programmers to write programs that access hardware features of a computer without knowing exactly what hardware will be installed on the machine where the program eventually runs. DirectX achieves this by creating an intermediate layer that translates generic hardware commands into specific commands for particular pieces of hardware. In particular, DirectX lets multimedia applications take advantage of hardware acceleration features supported by graphics accelerators.  DirectX 2, released in 1996, supports the Direct3D architecture. DirectX 5, released in 1998, adds new layers to the DirectX API, In addition to the low-level layer that communicates directly with multimedia hardware, DirectX 5 also includes a Media layer that enables programmers to manipulate multimedia objects and streams. DirectX 5 also supports USB and IEEE 1394 buses, AGP, and MMX.  See also  All About DirectX in the "Did You Know...?" section of Webopedia.

dirty_bit
A bit in a memory cache or virtual memory page that has been modified by the CPU, but not yet written back to storage.

dirty_data
In reference to databases, data that contain errors. Dirty data can contain such mistakes as spelling or punctuation, incorrect data associated with a field, incomplete or outdated data or even data that is duplicated in the database.  Also see data integrity.

DISA
Short for the Data Interchange Standards Association, DISA is a not-for-profit organization with a mission of advancing the foundation of electronic commerce and trade by supporting and promoting standards used for business-to-business (B2B) data exchange.

DR_as_a_Service
A combination of the acronyms DR (disaster recovery) and SaaS (software as a service / storage as a service). The term DR-as-a-Service refers to an "always on" hosted disaster recovery solution, where the service provider or vendor, is responsible for deploying and managing applications and services required to support an organization's mission critical activities.
DR-as-a-Service targets small and medium sized businesses (SMB) by eliminating the need for upfront capital expenditure for  in-house IT expertise, and hardware deployments. As with SaaS, DR-as-a-Service is hosted remotely and pricing is based on a monthly fee.

disaster_recovery-as-a-Service_daas
Cloud-based services for helping to protect companies from the loss of mission-critical data in the event of a man-made or natural disaster. In addition to protecting data, Disaster Recovery-as-a-Service (DRaaS) offerings help ensure business continuity by minimizing downtime and disruption to customers, clients and employees in the event of server failure or other disaster.

Disaster Recovery-as-a-Service solutions also typically offer more than just data recovery protection by additionally being able to replicate infrastructure and applications to help ensure full continuity of business operations. DRaaS service providers include the likes of Dell, IBM, Virtustream, Windstream and many others.

disc
Alternative spelling of disk . Disc is often used for optical discs, while disk generally refers to magnetic discs, but there is no real rule.   

Disco
1. Disco hyperdata browser
Disco is a simple hyperdata browser used to navigate the  Semantic Web as an unbound set of data sources, such as static RDF files somewhere on the Web or RDF graphs. The browser renders all information about a specific resource as an HTML page, enabling users to visit the linked data (hyperdata) of resources. Disco is a server-side application that can be used without installing anything on your machine.
2. Microsoft DISCO Technology
DISCO is a Microsoft technology for publishing and discovering Web Services. DISCO can define a document format along with an interrogation algorithm, making it possible to discover the Web Services exposed on a given server. DISCO makes it possible to discover the capabilities of each Web Service (via documentation) and how to interact with it. To publish a deployed Web Service using DISCO, you simply need to create a .disco file and place it in the vroot along with the other service-related configuration.

discrete
(1) In audio/sound terms discrete refers to multichannel audio or soundtrack being stored with each individual  channel isolated from the other tracks. Contrast with matrixed where multichannels are blended. (2) (adj.) Refers to a computer component or device that is distinct and treated as an individual unit, separable from the other components and devices.

discretize
A process where each pixel of an image is converted into the black foreground or the white background. The colors and grays of the original image are lost. By controlling discretizing, unwanted parts of the original image can be removed. This process of converting color images into black foreground and white background is called discretizing.

disintermediation
Removing the middleman. The term is a popular buzzword used to describe many Internet -based businesses that use the World Wide Web to sell products directly to customers rather than going through traditional retail channels. By eliminating the middlemen, companies can sell their products cheaper and faster. Many people believe that the Internet will revolutionize the way products are bought and sold, and disintermediation is the driving force behind this revolution.

disk
A round plate on which data can be encoded. There are two basic types of disks: magnetic disks and optical disks.  On magnetic disks, data is encoded as microscopic magnetized needles on the disk's surface. You can record and erase data on a magnetic disk any number of times, just as you can with a cassette tape. Magnetic disks come in a number of different forms:  floppy disk : A typical 5¼-inch floppy disk can hold 360K or 1.2MB (megabytes). 3½-inch floppies normally store 720K, 1.2MB or 1.44MB of data. hard disk : Hard disks can store anywhere from 20MB to more than 200GB. Hard disks are also from 10 to 100 times faster than floppy disks. removable cartridge : Removable cartridges are hard disks encased in a metal or plastic cartridge, so you can remove them just like a floppy disk. Removable cartridges are very fast, though usually not as fast as fixed hard disks.   Optical disks record data by burning microscopic holes in the surface of the disk with a laser. To read the disk, another laser beam shines on the disk and detects the holes by changes in the reflection pattern.  Optical disks come in three basic forms:  CD-ROM : Most optical disks are read-only. When you purchase them, they are already filled with data. You can read the data from a CD-ROM, but you cannot modify, delete, or write new data. WORM : Stands for write-once, read-many. WORM disks can be written on once and then read any number of times; however, you need a special WORM disk drive to write data onto a WORM disk. erasable optical (EO  ): EO disks can be read to, written to, and erased just like magnetic disks.   The machine that spins a disk is called a disk drive. Within each disk drive is one or more heads (often called read/write heads) that actually read and write data.  Accessing data from a disk is not as fast as accessing data from main memory, but disks are much cheaper. And unlike RAM, disks hold on to data even when the computer is turned off. Consequently, disks are the storage medium of choice for most types of data. Another storage medium is magnetic tape. But tapes are used only for backup and archiving because they are sequential-access devices (to access data in the middle of a tape, the tape drive must pass through all the preceding data).  A new disk, called a blank disk, has no data on it. Before you can store data on a blank disk, however, you must format it 

disk_array
A disk array is a hardware element that contains a large group of hard disk drives (HDDs). It may contain several disk drive trays and has an architecture which improves speed and increases data protection. The system is run via a storage controller, which coordinates activity within the unit. Disk arrays form the backbone of modern storage networking environments. A storage area network (SAN) contains one or more disk arrays that function as the repository for the data which is moved in and out of the SAN.
Related Terms: LUNs and RAID
Logical Units: The data within a disk array is organized into Logical Units (LUs). Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) I/O commands are sent to a storage target and executed by an LU within that target.
LUN: A Logical Unit Number (LUN) is a unique identifier that is used to distinguish between devices that share the same SCSI bus. Commands that are sent to the SCSI controller identify devices based on their LUNs.


disk_cache
)A portion of RAM used to speed up access to data on a disk. The RAM can be part of the disk drive itself (sometimes called a hard disk  cache or buffer) or it can be general-purpose RAM in the computer that is reserved for use by the disk drive (sometimes called a soft  disk cache). Hard disk cachesare more effective, but they are also much more expensive, and therefore smaller. Nearly all modern disk drives include a small amount of internal cache.
A soft disk cache works by storing the most recently accessed data in the RAM cache. When a program needs to access new data, the operating system first checks to see if the data is in the cache before reading it from the disk. Because computers can access data from RAM much faster than from a disk, disk caching can significantly increase performance. Many cache systemsalso attempt to predict what data will be requested next so they can place that data in the cache ahead of time.
Although caching improves performance, there is some risk involved. If the computer crashes (due to a power failure, for example), the system may not have time to copy the cache back to the disk. In this case, whatever changes you made to the data will be lost. Usually, however, the cache system updates the disk frequently so that even if you lose some data, it will not be much. Caches that work in this manner are called write-back caches. Another type of disk cache, called a write-thru cache, removes the risk of losing data because it only caches data for read operations; writeoperations are always sent directly to the disk.

disk_compression
A type of data compression that works by storing compressed versions of files on the hard disk. A disk compression utility sits between the operating system and the disk drive. Whenever the operating system attempts to save a file to disk, the utility intercepts it and compresses it. Likewise, when the operating system attempts to open a file, the disk compression utility intercepts the file, decompresses it, and then passes it to the operating system. Because all applications access files through the operating system, disk compression utilities work with all applications. The entire process is transparent to the user, though opening and closing files may take a little longer. On the other hand, a disk compression utility can double the amount of disk space available.  Windows comes with a built-in disk compression utility called DriveSpace. You can also purchase third-party disk compression utilities for Windows and other operating systems. 

disk_controller
A chip and associated circuitry that is responsible for controlling a disk drive. There are different controllers for different interfaces. For example, an IDE interface requires an IDE controller and a SCSI interface requires a SCSI controller. On Macintosh computer systems, the disk controller is built into the motherboard.  A controller for a hard disk is called a hard disk controller (HDC), and a controller for a floppy disk is called a floppy disk controller (FDC). 

disk_drive
A disk drive is a randomly addressable and rewritable storage device. The term can be broadly interpreted to include optical drives and in earlier times, floppy drives. However, in popular usage, it has come to relate mainly to hard disk drives (HDDs).
Disk drives can either be housed internally within a computer or housed in a separate box that is external to the computer. They are found in PCs, servers, laptops and storage arrays, for example. They work by rotating very rapidly around a head or heads, which read and write data. They differ from solid state drives (SSDs), which have no moving parts and offer greater performance, but also cost more and generally offer less capacity.
Disk Drive Terms
Platter: Hard drives are normally composed of multiple disks called platters. These platters are stacked on top of each other. It is the platter that actually stores the data. It consists of a substrate coated with magnetic media. The substrate is there to act as a rigid support for the magnetic media. The magnetic layer is protected by a thin layer of carbon and a lubrication layer to prevent damage in case the head comes in contact with the platter surface. Typically, both sides of the platter have magnetic media on which to store data. Tens of thousands of tracks per inch can be laid down on these platters.
Spindle/Motor: The platters are attached at the center to a rod or pin called a spindle that is directly attached to the shaft of the motor that controls the speed of rotation.


disk_image
Also called a disk clone, an exact copy of a computer��s hard drive. The copy includes all the partition information, boot sectors, the file allocation table, operating system installation and application software. Disk images are used to transfer a hard drive��s contents during a hardware upgrade, to restore a hard drive��s contents during disaster recovery or when a hard drive is erased, and to transfer the contents of a hard drive from one computer to another.  The process of creating a disk image is called disk imagine or disk cloning. Typically, special disk imaging software is required to copy the hard drive data.

disk_mirroring
A technique in which data is written to two duplicate disks simultaneously. This way if one of the disk drives fails, the system can instantly switch to the other disk without any loss of data or service. Disk mirroring is used commonly in on-line database systems where it's critical that the data be accessible at all times. 

disk_optimizer
A program that makes a disk more efficient. Disk optimizer us a variety of techniques, including defragmenting the disk. Fragmentation occurs naturally when a disk is used often. 

disk_pack
A stack of removable hard disks encased in a metal or plastic container.  

disk_scrubbing
Refers to a software utility used to completely  wipe-out  hard disk drives. This type of utility can usually overwrite single files, unused space on a disk, or a whole disk drive, using a series of algorithms to make it highly unlikely that anyone could ever retrieve the original data from the disk.Also see "Are Deleted Files Completely Erased?" in the "Did You Know . . . ?" section of Webopedia.

disk_striping
A technique for spreading data over multiple disk drives. Disk striping can speed up operations that retrieve data from disk storage. The computer system breaks a body of data into units and spreads these units across the available disks. Systems that implement disk striping generally allow the user to select the data unit size or stripe width.  Disk striping is available in two types. Single user striping uses relatively large data units, and improves performance on a single-user workstation by allowing parallel transfers from different disks. Multi-user striping uses smaller data units and improves performance in a multi-user environment by allowing simultaneous (or overlapping) read operations on multiple disk drives.  Disk striping stores each data unit in only one place and does not offer protection from disk failure. 

disk_thrashing
In systems that use virtual memory, the resulting condition of a hard drive being used excessively for virtual memory because the physical memory (i.e., RAM) is full. (The process of moving data into and out of virtual memory also is called swapping pages.) Disk thrashing considerably slows down the performance of a system because data has to be transferred back and forth from the hard drive to the physical memory.  A sure sign that your computer is thrashing is when an application stops responding but the disk drive light keeps blinking on and off. Thrashing is generally caused by too many processes competing for scarce memory resources. To temporarily stop thrashing, you need to terminate one or more applications. To stop it permanently, you need to install more main memory.  Disk thrashing can result in permanent failure of the hard drive; as the data is transferred back and forth, the hard drive��s read/write heads are subjected to considerable wear and tear. 

diskless_workstation
A diskless workstation or PC on a local-area network (LAN) is a computer system that does not have its own disk. Instead, it stores files on a network file server.
This type of system uses network booting to load the operating system, but it does contain its own main components including the CPU, RAM, video, sound and network adapter (see "workstation" for a description of common components).
Diskless workstations can reduce the overall cost of a LAN because one large-capacity disk drive is usually less expensive than several low-capacity drives. In addition, diskless workstations can simplify backups and security because all files are in one place -- on the file server. Also, accessing data from a large remote file server is often faster than accessing data from a small local storage device. One disadvantage of diskless workstations, however, is that they are useless if the network fails.

display
(v) To make data or images appear on a monitor.  (n) Short for display screen  or monitor.  

display_screen
The display part of a monitor. Most display screens work under the same principle as a television, using a cathode ray tube  (CRT). Consequently, the term CRT is often used in place of display screen.   

dissolve
In graphics and video editing dissolve is a term used to describe a transition effect in which one video clip (or one image) is gradually fads out while another image simultaneously replaces the original one. Also called video dissolve, film dissolve, or linear light blend. The overall objective is for the image or clip to appear to seamlessly transition from one image to the other in a fluid motion.

distance_learning
A type of education, typically college-level, where students work on their own at home or at the office and communicate with faculty and other students via e-mail, electronic forums, videoconferencing, chat rooms, bulletin boards, instant messaging and other forms of computer-based communication.
Most distance learning programs include a computer-based training (CBT) system and communications tools to produce a virtual  classroom. Because the Internet and World Wide Web are accessible from virtually all computer platforms, they serve as the foundation for many distance learning systems.
Contrast with Web-based training.

distributed_computing
A type of computing in which different components and objects comprising an application can be located on different computers connected to a network. So, for example, a word processing application might consist of an editor component on one computer, a spell-checker object on a second computer, and a thesaurus on a third computer. In some distributed computing systems, each of the three computers could even be running a different operating system.   One of the requirements of distributed computing is a set of standards that specify how objects communicate with one another. There are currently two chief distributed computing standards: CORBA and DCOM.  

distributed_database
A database that consists of two or more data files located at different sites on a computer network. Because the database is distributed, different users can access it without interfering with one another. However, the DBMS must periodically synchronize the scattered databases to make sure that they all have consistent data.   

distributed_file_system
(dis-trib´ū-tid fīl sis´t&m) (n.) A method of storing and accessing files based in a client/server architecture. In a distributed file system, one or more central servers store files that can be accessed, with proper authorization rights, by any number of remote clients in the network. Much like an operating system organizes files in a hierarchical file management system, the distributed system uses a uniform naming convention and a mapping scheme to keep track of where files are located. When the client device retrieves a file from the server, the file appears as a normal file on the client machine, and the user is able to work with the file in the same ways as if it were stored locally on the workstation. When the user finishes working with the file, it is returned over the network to the server, which stores the now-altered file for retrieval at a later time.
Distributed file systems can be advantageous because they make it easier to distribute documents to multiple clients and they provide a centralized storage system so that client machines are not using their resources to store files.
NFS from Sun Microsystems and Dfs from Microsoft are examples of distributed file systems.

distributed_processing
Distributed processing is a phrase used to refer to a variety of computer systems that use more than one computer (or processor) to run an application. This includes parallel processing in which a single computer uses more than one CPU  to execute programs.
More often, however, distributed processing refers to local-area networks (LANs) designed so that a single program can run simultaneously at various sites. Most distributed processing systems contain sophisticated software that detects idle CPUs on the network and parcels out programs to utilize them.
Another form of distributed processing involves distributed databases. This is databases in which the data is stored across two or more computer systems. The database system keeps track of where the data is so that the distributed nature of the database is not apparent to users.

Distribution_Point
A point within a network where the cable or fiber terminates. This point provides a point of entry for engineers to terminate or test the network.

distribution_system
In IEEE 802.11 terminology, a distribution system interconnects Basic Service Set (BSS) to build a premise-wide network that allows users of mobile equipment to roam and stay connected to the available network resources. Distribution systems can be wired, usually via Ethernet or wireless when using the radio device inside the access point.

distro
Short for distribution, distro is a term used to describe a specific distribution of Linux that is built from the common Linux operating system and includes additional applications. Red Hat,  Debian and SuSe are all examples of a distro.

dithering
)Creating the illusion of new colors and shades by varying the pattern of dots. Newspaper photographs, for example, are dithered. If you look closely, you can see that different shades of gray are produced by varying the patterns of black and white dots. There are no gray dots at all. The more dither patterns that a device or program supports, the more shades of gray it can represent. In printing, dithering is usually called halftoning, and shades of gray are called halftones.  Note that dithering differs from gray scaling. In gray scaling, each individual dot can have a different shade of gray.   

DiVA
A publishing system that treats the electronic copy of a document as the "digital master" for both the electronic and print versions. The data originally entered by the document author is also used as the basis for creation, reuse and enhancement of all meta data. DiVA is developed and is maintained by the DiVA Project team by the Electronic Publishing Centre at Uppsala University Library, Sweden.  The DiVA Document Format (DDF) is defined by an XML schema that supports the storage of the full text content and its metadata in a single XML file.

Divx
(1) Short for Digital video express, a new DVD-ROM format promoted by several large Hollywood companies, including Disney, Dreamworks SKG, Paramount and Universal. With Divx, a movie (or other data) loaded onto a DVD-ROM is playable only during a specific time frame, typically two days. As soon as you begin playing a Divx disc, the counter starts. Each Divx player is connected to a telephone outlet and communicates with a central server to exchange billing information.  Divx discs have the potential to ultimately replace video tapes. They're especially convenient for video rentals because there are no late fees. Once you purchase a Divx title, you never need to return it. However, Divx has thrown a monkey wrench in the DVD market because the Divx format is not backward-compatible with current DVD-ROM players. This means that you need to buy a new Divx player to play Divx titles. Understandably, people and companies who have already invested in non-Divx players are not pleased.  (2) When spelled DivX, a trademark of DivXNetworks, Inc. DivX is a digital video compression format based on the MPEG-4 technology. DivX files can be downloaded over high-speed lines in a relatively short time without sacrificing the quality of the digital video.

DivX_HD
The high definition (HD) version of the DivX format. DivX HD supports six-channel, 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound and delivers 720p HD resolution video at 4Mbps. DivX HD content can be viewed on HDTV with your PC or with a DivX HD DVD player. See also DivX.

DLA
Short for drive letter access, DLA is a type of commercially available package that enables users to access optical storage media, CD or DVD, in a manner similar to how one uses a standard floppy disk.

DLC
(1) Short for Data Link Control, the second lowest layer in the OSI Reference Model. Every network interface card (NIC) has a DLC address or DLC identifier (DLCI) that uniquely identifies the node on the network. Some network protocols, such as Ethernet and Token-Ring use the DLC addresses exclusively. Other protocols, such as TCP/IP, use a logical address at the Network Layer to identify nodes. Ultimately, however, all network addresses must be translated to DLC addresses. In TCP/IP networks, this translation is performed with the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).  For networks that conform to the IEEE 802 standards (e.g., Ethernet ), the DLC address is usually called the Media Access Control (MAC) address. See a breakdown of the seven OSI layers in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.  (2) Short for digital loop carrier.

DLCI
Short for data link connection identifier. A number of a private or switched virtual circuit in a Frame Relay network that tells the Frame Relay how to route the data. The DLCI field identifies which logical circuit the data travels over.

DLL
1) Short for Dynamic Link Library, a library of executable functions or data that can be used by a Windows application. Typically, a DLL provides one or more particular functions and a program accesses the functions by creating either a static or dynamic link to the DLL. A static link remains constant during program execution while a dynamic link is created by the program as needed. DLLs can also contain just data. DLL files usually end with the extension .dll,.exe., drv, or .fon.
A DLL can be used by several applications at the same time. Some DLLs are provided with the Windows operating system and available for any Windows application. Other DLLs are written for a particular application and are loaded with the application.


DLNA
Short for Digital Living Network Alliance.

DLP
Short for Digital Light Processing, a new technology developed by Texas Instruments used for projecting images from a monitor onto a large screen for presentations. Prior to the development of DLP, most computer projection systems were based on LCD technology which tends to produce faded and blurry images. DLP uses tiny mirrors housed on a special kind of microchip called a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD). The result is sharp images that can be clearly seen even in a normally lit room.  

dlp-data-loss-prevention
Data loss prevention, or DLP, refers to technology or software developed to protect and prevent the potential for data loss or theft. Data loss protection software is designed to monitor, detect and prevent the loss of data while it's at rest, either in on-premises storage drives or in the cloud, as well as when it's in use or in transit.
DLP policies and technology are a key component is an organization's comprehensive security procedures, and they help to ensure that confidential or sensitive corporate information isn't accessed or transmitted without proper authorization.
Data Loss Prevention is almost always accompanied by other hardware and software security measures in an enterprise such as firewalls, antivirus and anti-malware software and intrusion detection systems (IDS).

DLS
Short for Distributed Link Software it is a hypermedia link service that can be used to provide links for users on the World Wide Web. In the same way that a client connects to a remote Web server to access a document, DLS allows the client to connect to a link server to request a set of links to apply to the data in a document. The link service is mediated by the WWW in HTTP messages, and implemented by CGI processes located on Web servers.

DLSw
Short for Data-Link Switching. DLSw is a means of tunneling Systems Network Architecture (SNA) and NetBIOS traffic over an IP network. Before the development of DLSw, SNA and NetBIOS traffic was transported via Source-Route Bridging (SRB), a protocol for transporting in token ring environments. DLSw uses Switch to Switch protocol instead of SRB between routers to create DLSw peer connections, locate resources, forward data, handle flow control and error recovery. The routers are called data link switches.  Initially a proprietary solution developed by IBM in 1992, DLSw was submitted to the IETF as RFC 1434 in 1993. DLSw is now documented in detail by RFC 1795, submitted in April 1995. 

DLT
Short for Digital Linear Tape, a type of magnetic tape storage device originally developed by DEC and now marketed by several companies. DLTs are ��-inch wide and the cartridges come in several sizes ranging from 20 to over 40 GB. DLT drives are faster than most other types of tape drives, achieving transfer rates of 2.5 MBps. 

DM
(1) On the Twitter Web site (a free social messaging tool), DM is short for direct message, and it is used to send a private tweet (Twitter update) to a person you are following. (2) Short for deathmatch.

DMA
Short for direct memory access, a technique for transferring data from main memory to a device without passing it through the CPU. Computers that have DMA channels can transfer data to and from devices much more quickly than computers without a DMA channel can. This is useful for making quick backups and for real-time applications.
Some expansion boards, such as CD-ROM cards, are capable of accessing the computer's DMA channel. When you install the board, you must specify which DMA channel is to be used, which sometimes involves setting a jumper or DIP switch.


DMCA
Short for the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, an act of Congress that was signed into law on October 28th, 1998, by President Clinton. DMCA's purpose is to update U.S. copyright laws for the digital age.  Briefly, the DMCA stipulates the following conditions: It is a crime to circumvent anti-piracy measures that are built into commercial software. It is a crime to manufacture, sell or distribute code-cracking devices that illegally copy software. However, it is not a crime to crack copyright protection devices in order to conduct encryption research, assess product interoperability or test the security of computer systems. Under certain circumstances, nonprofit libraries, archives and education institutions are exempt from the anti-circumvention provisions. The copyright infringement liability of ISPs that simply transmit information over the Internet is limited. However, ISPs must remove material from users' Web sites that appears to constitute copyright infringement. The liability for copyright infringement by faculty members and graduate students of nonprofit institutions of higher education is limited when the institutions serve as ISPs and under certain circumstances. Webcasters must pay licensing fees to record companies. The Register of Copyrights must submit to Congress recommendations regarding how to promote distance education through digital technologies while "maintaining an appropriate balance between the rights of copyright owners and the needs of users."

DMCA_1201
Also known as the DMCA Anticircumvention Provision, a section of the DMCA that makes it a crime to traffic in technology that circumvents copy protection.

DMI
Short for Desktop Management Interface, an API to enable software to collect information about a computer environment. For example, using DMI a program can determine what software and expansion boards are installed on a computer.  DMI is designed to be platform -independent and operating system -independent so that programs can make the same function calls to collect information no matter what system they're running in. This system independence is implemented by collecting information from MIF files, which are plain text files containing information about a software or hardware component.  DMI was designed by the Desktop Management Task Force (DMTF), a consortium of hardware manufacturers led by Intel. Version 2.0 allows a central computer not only to gather information about computers connected to a network, but also to configure them. PCs that comply with DMI 2.0 are sometimes called managed PCs. 

DML
SHort for Data Manipulation Language, a set of statements used to store, retrieve, modify, and erase data from a database. There are two types of DML: procedural, in which the user specifies what data is needed and how to get it; and nonprocedural, in which the user specifies only what data is needed. 

DMTF
Short for Distributed Management Task Force, DMTF is an industry organization for the development, adoption and promotion of interoperable management standards and integration technology for enterprise and Internet environments. DMTF technologies include the following:  Common Information Model (CIM)  Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM)  Desktop and mobile Architecture for System (DASH) Initiative  Systems Management Architecture for Server Hardware (SMASH) Initiative  System Management BIOS (SMBIOS)  Alert Standard Format (ASF)  Common Diagnostic Model (CDM)  Management Component Transport Protocol (MCTP)   The DMTF was founded in Founded in 1992.

DMZ
(pronounced as separate letters) Short for demilitarized zone, a computer or small subnetwork that sits between a trusted internal network, such as a corporate private LAN, and an untrusted external network, such as the public Internet.
Typically, the DMZ contains devices accessible to Internet traffic, such as Web (HTTP ) servers, FTP servers, SMTP (e-mail) servers and DNSservers.
The term comes from military use, meaning a buffer area between two enemies.

DNA_computer
A nanocomputer that uses DNA (deoxyribonucleic acids) to store information and perform complex calculations.  In 1994, University of Southern California computer scientist Leonard Adelman suggested that DNA could be used to solve complex mathematical problems. Adelman found a way to harness the power of DNA to solve the Hamiltonian path problem (the traveling salesman problem), whose solution required finding a path from start to end going through all the points (cities) only once.  Each city was encoded as its own DNA sequence (DNA sequence consists of a series of nucleotides represented by the letters A, T, G, C).  The DNA sequences were set to replicate and create trillions of new sequences based on the initial input sequences in a matter of seconds (called DNA hybridization). The theory holds that the solution to the problem was one of the new sequence strands. By process of elimination, the correct solution would be obtained.  Adelman's experiment is regarded as the first example of true nanotechnology.  The main benefit of using DNA computers to solve complex problems is that different possible solutions are created all at once. This is known as parallel processing. Humans and most electronic computers must attempt to solve the problem one process at a time (linear processing). DNA itself provides the added benefits of being a cheap, energy-efficient resource.  In a different perspective, more than 10 trillion DNA molecules can fit into an area no larger than 1 cubic centimeter. With this, a DNA computer could hold 10 terabytes of data and perform 10 trillion calculations at a time.

DNIS
Short for dialed number identification service, a telephone service that identifies for the receiver what telephone number was dialed by the caller. A common use for this type of system is 800 and 900 phone numbers that often channel multiple phone numbers into the same PBX system. Once the call enters the PBX system, the DNIS will identify which number was dialed and record that information.

DNS
(1) Short for Domain Name System (or Service or Server), an Internet service that translates domain names into IP addresses. Because domain names are alphabetic, they're easier to remember. The Internet however, is really based on IP addresses. Every time you use a domain name, therefore, a DNS service must translate the name into the corresponding IP address. For example, the domain name www.example.com might translate to 198.105.232.4.
The DNS system is, in fact, its own network. If one DNS server doesn't know how to translate a particular domain name, it asks another one, and so on, until the correct IP address is returned.
(2) Short for digital nervous system,a term coined by Bill Gates to describe a network of personal computers that make it easier to obtain and understand information.

DNS_parking
In the Web hosting business, DNS parking is a service that the Web host will offer to its clients as a way of securing a domain name for future use. The Web host registers the domain name with the InterNIC and "parks" the domain name on a server until it is ready to be made active. By doing this, the Web host ensures the availability of the domain name for the client's future use so that another individual or company cannot register that same domain name.

DNS_SEC
Short for DNS Security Extensions, DNS SEC is a set of extensions used to add an additional layer of security to the Domain Name System (DNS). DNS SEC was designed to prevent specific types of popular attacks on the Internet and protect against these threats to the Domain Name System. The specific extensions provide origin authentication of DNS data, data integrity and also to authenticate denial of existence. May also be seen written as DNSSEC.

DNSBL
Short for DNS Based List, DNS Blacklist, or DNS Blocklist.  A published list of IP addresses that can be queried through the Internet. DNSBLs are used to publish IP addresses associated with  e-mail spam and spamming. Most mail servers can be configured to reject messages from addresses on a DNSBL. An address found in a DNSBL may be directly associated with spam, or may have made the list due to Web server vulnerabilities that can be used by spammers. There are many DNSBLs available, each published and maintained by different individuals and organizations. See also Realtime Blackhole List.

dnschanger
DNSChanger, also referred to as DNS Changer and nicknamed the "Internet doomsday" virus, is a type of malware used by hackers to change a user's DNS server settings, replacing the ISP's valid DNS servers with rogue DNS servers operated by the hacker or a third party.
In November 2011 the U.S. FBI discovered a network of rogue DNS servers that were being sent traffic by computers infected with the DNSChanger malware. The FBI disabled these servers and replaced them with servers that would share valid DNS addresses.
However, in a cost-cutting move the FBI shut these servers down on July 9th, 2012, which meant computers still infected with DNSChanger would no longer be able to access the Internet unless the DNS settings for these computers were redirected to new, "clean" DNS servers.

DOA
On eBay, eBay alternatives, and classified ad Web sites, DOA is an abbreviation used to mean dead on arrival, meaning item did not work when received by the buyer.
See also "Online Auction Abbreviations" in the  Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

doa-report
In CRM (customer relationship management), the DOA (Dead on Arrival) CRM report tells users which products are the most error-prone or receive the most complaints from customers.The goal of this report is to help a business to better understand where customers are having problems and why.
The CRM DOA Report is derived from customer service calls and emails -- including requests for refunds or exchanges -- as well as customer surveys. This report is useful because it can pick up little things that you missed but could hurt your business.
See "The 10 Most Important CRM Reports" on eCRM Guide for a better understanding of this team.

docker
An open-source project for automating the deployment of applications as portable, self-sufficient containers that can run virtually anywhere on any type of server. Docker serves as a lightweight alternative to full machine virtualization provided by traditional hypervisors like VMware's ESXi, Xen or KVM.
With a traditional hypervisor approach, each virtual machine (VM) needs its own operating system, but with Docker, applications operate inside a container that resides on a single host operating system that can serve many different containers.
Docker containers are designed to run on everything from physical computers to virtual machines, bare-metal servers, OpenStack cloud clusters, public instances and more. Docker extends the LinuX Containers (LXC) format, which serves to provide an isolated environment for applications, by enabling image management and deployment services.

docking_station
A platform into which you can install a portable computer. The docking station typically contains slots for expansion cards, bays for storage devices, and connectors for peripheral devices, such as printers and monitors. Once inserted in a docking station, the portable computer essentially becomes a desktop model computer. When it is taken out, it becomes a portable computer again. Most importantly, the same data is accessible in both modes because it resides on the portable computer's drives. The idea behind docking stations is to let you simultaneously enjoy the expansion possibilities of desktop model computers with the portability of notebook computers. In addition, the docking station enables you to use a full-size keyboard and monitor when you're not traveling. 

Docomo
 DoCoMo (meaning "anywhere" in Japanese) is a NTT subsidiary and Japan's biggest mobile service provider, with over 31 million subscribers as of June, 2000.   In February, 2000 NTT DoCoMo launched its i-mode service. With over 7 million subscribers, it has overtaken traditional Japanese Internet service providers to become Japan's biggest Internet access platform.   DoCoMo's i-mode is the only network in the world that now allows subscribers continuous access to the Internet via mobile telephone. The service lets users send and receive e-mail, exchange photographs, do online shopping and banking, download personalized ringing melodies for their phones, and navigate among more than 7,000 specially formatted Web sites.   The current i-mode data transmission speed is just 9.6Kbps, but in spring 2001 NTT DoCoMo will introduce its next-generation mobile system, based on wideband CDMA (W-CDMA), that can support speeds of 384Kbps or faster, making mobile multimedia possible. 

DOCSIS
 Developed by CableLabs and approved by the ITU in March 1998, Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification defines interface standards for cable modems and supporting equipment.   With certification from CableLabs, manufacturers will be able to produce cable modems for retail, so consumers no longer have to depend on leased cable modems from their cable providers.   Other devices that recognize and support the DOCSIS standard include HDTVs and Web enabled set-top boxes for regular televisions.   DOCSIS specifies downstream traffic transfer rates between 27 and 36 Mbps over a radio frequency (RF) path in the 50 MHz to 750+ MHz range, and upstream traffic tranfer rates between 320 Kbps and 10 Mbps over a RF path between 5 and 42 MHz. But, because data over cable travels on a shared loop, individuals will see tranfer rates drop as more users gain access.   In 1998, there were 1.2 million cable modems installed across the United States with an average price of $245 per unit, and by 2004, research reports predict there will be 24.3 million units installed across the US with an average price of $50 per unit. 

document
(n.) In the PC world, the term was originally used for a file created with a word processor. In addition to text, documents can contain graphics, charts, and other objects.  Increasingly, the line separating word processing files from files produced by other applications is becoming blurred. A word processing application can produce graphics and a graphics application can produce words. This trend has accelerated with technologies such as OLE and OpenDoc that allow an application to combine many components. Consequently, the term document is used more and more to describe any file produced by an application. Interestingly, the term has always been used this way in Macintosh environments.  (v.) To enter written explanations. For example, programmers are always exhorted to document their code by inserting comments. 

document_flip
A feature in some applications that allow you to flip between open documents within that specific program using a single mouse movement or keystroke. When referring to hardware features, like that of a computer mouse, document flip may also refer to flipping from one program to another, similar to how tabs are used for browsing.

document_management
The computerized management of electronic as well as paper-based documents. Document management systems generally include the following components:  An optical scanner and OCR system to convert paper documents into an electronic form A database system to organized stored documents A search mechanism to quickly find specific documents   Document management systems are becoming more important as it becomes increasingly obvious that the paperless office is an ideal that may never be achieved. Instead, document management systems strive to create systems that can handle paper and electronic documents together.  

Document_Type_Declaration
Abbreviated as DTDecl, Document Type Declaration is is a XML system that provides information for a parser to validate XML documents. DTDecl defines the constraints of the logical structure and supports the use of predefined storage units. Declarations also allow a document to communicate meta information to the parser, including attribute values and their types, the names of external files that may be referenced, in addition to some external and non-XML data that may be included.

documentation
Instructions for using a computer device or program. Documentation can appear in a variety of forms, the most common being manuals. When you buy a computer product (hardware or software), it almost always comes with one or more manuals that describe how to install and operate the product. In addition, many software products include an online version of the documentation that you can display on your screen or print out on a printer. A special type of online documentation is a help  system , which has the documentation embedded into the program. Help systems are often called context-sensitive because they display different information depending on the user's position (context) in the application.
Documentation is often divided into the following categories:

installation: Describes how to install a program or device but not how to use it. 
reference: Detailed descriptions of particular items presented in alphabetical order. Reference documentation is designed for people who are already somewhat familiar with the product but need reminders or very specific information about a particular topic. 
tutorial: Teaches a user how to use the product. Tutorials move at a slower pace than reference manuals and generally contain less detail. 

A frequent lament from computer users is that their documentation is inscrutable. Fortunately, this situation is improving, thanks largely to advances in help systems and online tutorials. These forms of documentation make it much easier to deliver the specific information a user needs when he or she needs it.

DOI
Short for Digital Object Identifier, a standard for online content identification and linking based on URI and URN and governed by the International DOI Foundation. Digital content using the DOI system is given a unique alphanumeric character string that is used as an identifier. The identifier is comprised of a prefix and a suffix, separated by a forward slash. The prefix is assigned by the registering agency and identifies the specific organization, and the suffix is provided by the registrant to identify the unique content. The DOI also comes with metadata that describes the content. The DOI of an object is permanent so that the content can always be easily located if the URL of it changes (the user will be redirected to the new location). The technology was developed to protect the copyright of material published on the Internet, to compensate content creators for their work, and to keep track of content.

Dolby_Digital
A standard for high-quality digital audio that is used for the sound portion of video stored in digital format, especially videos stored on DVD-ROMs. Dolby Digital delivers 6 channels in the 5.1 configuration: left, right, and center screen channels, separate left and right sounds, and a subwoofer channel. This is sometimes called surround sound  or 3D sound.  

Dolby_Digital_EX
Dolby Digital EX takes the Dolby Digital 5.1-channel setup one step further with an additional center surround channel (reproduced through one or two speakers) for extra dimensional detail and an enveloping surround sound effect. Feature films originally released in Dolby Digital Surround EX (the cinema version) carry the encoded extra surround channel in their subsequent DVD releases, as well as onto 5.1-channel digital satellite and TVasts.

Dolby_Digital_Plus
Dolby Digital Plus is the next-generation audio technology for all high-definition programming and media. Built on Dolby Digital, the multichannel audio standard for DVD and HD broadcasts worldwide, Dolby Digital Plus was designed for the delivery formats of the future, but remains fully compatible with all current A/V receivers.  [Source: Dolby Technologies] 
Dolby Digital Plus supports two important new digital connections:  High-Definition Media Interface (HDMI) and IEEE 1394 (FireWire). Other features of Dolby Digital Plus include:

Multichannel sound with discrete channel output.
Channel and program extensions can carry multichannel audio programs of up to 7.1 channels.
Supports data rates as high as 6 Mbps.
Bit rate performance of at least 3 Mbps on HD DVD and up to 4.7 Mbps on Blu-ray Disc.
Supported by HDMI, the new single-cable digital connection for high-definition audio and video.


Dolby_Laboratories
Dolby Laboratories develops and delivers products and technologies that make the entertainment experience more realistic and immersive. For four decades Dolby has been at the forefront of defining high-quality audio and surround sound in cinema, broadcast, home audio systems, cars, DVDs, headphones, games, televisions, and personal computers. Based in San Francisco with European headquarters in England, the company has entertainment industry liaison offices in New York and Los Angeles, and licensing liaison offices in London, Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, and Tokyo.

Dolby_Pro_Logic_IIx
Dolby Pro Logic IIx is an extension of Dolby Pro Logic II technology. This sophisticated algorithm processes native stereo- and 5.1-channel material to produce 6.1 or 7.1 output channels. Dolby Pro Logic IIx expands choice in playback system configuration (allowing 5.1 , 6.1, or 7.1 playback channels) and, when incorporated into an audio/video (AV) receiver or processor it allows a convenient upgrade path from a traditional 5.1-channel sound system to 7.1 output channels. [Source: Dolby Technologies]

Dolby_Surround
Dolby Surround is the consumer version of the original Dolby multichannel analog film sound format — Dolby analog and Dolby SR (Spectral Recording). When a Dolby Surround soundtrack is produced, four channels of audio information (Left, Center, Right and Mono) surround are matrix-encoded onto two audio tracks. These two tracks are then carried on stereo program sources such as videotapes and TV broadcasts into the home, where they can be decoded by Dolby Pro Logic to recreate the original four-channel surround sound experience.
With the introduction of the Dolby Digital multichannel film sound format, Dolby Digital has replaced Dolby Surround as the preferred technology to deliver multichannel audio to consumers via DVD-Video, digital television, and games.  [Source: Dolby Technologies]

Dolby_TrueHD
Dolby TrueHD is the next-generation lossless technology developed for high-definition disc-based media. Features of Dolby TrueHD include; 100 percent lossless coding technology, up to 18 Mbps bit rate, support for up to eight full-range channels of 24-bit/96 kHz audio, and it is supported by High-Definition Media Interface (HDMI). [Source: Dolby Technologies]

DOM
Short for Document Object Model, the specification for how objects in a Web page (text, images, headers, links, etc.) are represented. The DOM defines what attributes are associated with each object, and how the objects and attributes can be manipulated. Dynamic HTML (DHTML) relies on the DOM to dynamically change the appearance of Web pages after they have been downloaded to a user's browser.
Unfortunately, the two leading browsers -- Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer -- use different DOMs. This is one reason why their respective implementations of DHTML are so different. Both companies have submitted their DOMs to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for standardization, which now has the daunting task of specifying a standard DOM without alienating either of the browser giants. The W3C's DOM specification will support both HTML and XML.


domain
(1) A group of computers and devices on a network that are administered as a unit with common rules and procedures. Within the Internet, domains are defined by the IP address. All devices sharing a common part of the IP address are said to be in the same domain.
(2) In database technology, domain refers to the description of an attribute's allowed values. The physical description is a set of values the attribute can have, and the semantic, or logical, description is the meaning of the attribute.


domain_controller
As defined by Microsoft, in Active Directory server roles, computers that function as servers within a domain can have one of two roles: member server or domain controller. Abbreviated as DC, domain controller is a server on a Microsoft Windows or Windows NT network that is responsible for allowing host access to Windows  domain resources. The domain controllers in your network are the centerpiece of your Active Directory directory service.  It stores user account information, authenticates users and enforces security policy for a Windows domain.
See Active Directory. See also member server.

domain_hosting
Domain hosting refers to businesses that specialize in hosting domain names for individuals and companies.  Domain names are used in URLs to identify particular Web pages.
Domain hosting is frequently used synonymously with Web hosting since many domain hosting companies offer both services in one package, but domain names can be hosted by themselves or in conjunction with Website hosting, email hosting, game hosting and so on..
Also see hosting services and Web hosting terms in Webopedia.

Domain_Join
A feature in Microsoft's Windows 7 operating system that enables users to connect their home PC to a domain (e.g., your office computer network). The Professional and Ultimate editions of Windows 7 offers a wizard that will prompt you step-by-step to connect to a domain.

domain_migration
Moving data from one system, or domain, to another without compromising security or losing any of the data. Domain migration happens when servers are upgraded and the data (including any authentication and authorization information) must be moved to a new system, when an administrator changes from one ISP to another or when an Web site��s administrator moves the data that creates a Web page (any mark-up language coding and images) from one system, or domain, to another.

domain_name
Domain names are used to identify one or more IP addresses. For example, the domain name microsoft.com represents about a dozen IP addresses. Domain names are used in URLs to identify particular Web pages. For example, in the URL http://www.pcwebopedia.com/index.html, the domain name is pcwebopedia.com. 
Every domain name has a suffix that indicates which top level domain (TLD) it belongs to. There are only a limited number of such domains. For example:

gov - Government agencies
edu - Educational institutions
org - Organizations (nonprofit)
mil - Military
com - commercial business
net - Network organizations
ca - Canada
th - Thailand

Because the Internet is based on IP addresses, not domain names, every Web server requires a Domain Name System (DNS) server to translate domain names into IP addresses.

domain_name_administrative_contact
In  domain name system terminology, the administrative contact is the individual who is authorized by the  registrant to interact with Network Solutions or domain name registrar to answer questions about the domain name registration and registrant. See "Registering a Domain Name" and "Understanding Internet Governance" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia. See also "Countries and Their Domain Extensions" in  Webopedia's Quick Reference Section.

domain_name_billing_contact
In  domain name system terminology, the billing contact is the individual who is authorized by the registrant to receive the invoice for domain name registration and domain name renewal fees. See "Registering a Domain Name" and "Understanding Internet Governance" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia. See also "Countries and Their Domain Extensions" in  Webopedia's Quick Reference Section.

domain_name_dispute
A domain name dispute is a conflict that arises when more than one individual or group believes it has the right to register a specific domain name. Most commonly a domain name dispute would occur when a domain name similar to a registered trademark is registered by an individual or organization who is not the trademark owner. All domain name registrars must follow the ICANN's Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP).See "Registering a Domain Name" and "Understanding Internet Governance" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia. See also "Countries and Their Domain Extensions" in  Webopedia's Quick Reference Section.

domain_name_naming_authority
In  domain name system terminology, the naming authority is the entity responsible for the allocation and distribution of  domain names. A naming authority is often restricted to a particular level of domains such as .com, .net, or .edu. See "Registering a Domain Name" and "Understanding Internet Governance" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia. See also "Countries and Their Domain Extensions" in  Webopedia's Quick Reference Section.

domain_name_registrant
The person, company or entity who owns or holds a  domain name. When corporations and companies register a domain name, the registrant should be the company name (not an individual employee within the company) to ensure the business maintains ownership of the domain name.
 
See "Registering a Domain Name" and "Understanding Internet Governance" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia. See also "Countries and Their Domain Extensions" in  Webopedia's Quick Reference Section.

domain_name_registrar
Also called registrar domain name registrar is an ICANN or national ccTLD accredited company who has the authority to register domain names. Registrars are competitive retailers of domain names like .info, .coop, .mobi, .name, .pro, .museums, and others.

domain_name_renewal
Domain names need to be renewed on a yearlybasis. Some registrars offer discounts when a registrant renews a domain name for periods of 2, 3 or 5 years. When you renew a domain name you should also verify that the contact information is up-to-date.

domain_name_resolvers
Also called resolvers, domain name resolvers are the names given to computers, commonly located with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or institutional networks that are used to respond to a user request to resolve a domain name. These computers translate a domain name into an IP address. Also called DNS resolvers. See "Registering a Domain Name" and "Understanding Internet Governance" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia. See also "Countries and Their Domain Extensions" in  Webopedia's Quick Reference Section.

domain_parking
Same as DNS parking.

domain_registration
Domain registration refers to the process of registering a domain name, which identifies one or more IP addresses with a name that is easier to remember and use in URLs to identify particular Web pages. The person or business that registers  domain name is called the domain name registrant.
Domain registration requires utilizing the services of a domain name registrar, an ICANN or national ccTLD accredited company that has the authority to register domain names. Registrars help individuals and organizations register a domain name that has an extension like .com, .org, .net, .info, .biz, .us, .mobi, .name, .pro, .tv, etc.

dongle
A device that attaches to a computer to control access to a particular application. Dongles provide the most effective means of copy protection. Typically, the dongle attaches to a PC's parallel port. On Macintoshes, the dongle sometimes attaches to the ADB port. The dongle passes through all data coming through the port so it does not prevent the port from being used for other purposes. In fact, it's possible to attach several dongles to the same port.


donut
Donut is the dessert-themed Android codename for the version 1.6 update of the open source Android mobile operating system.  Donut made its debut in fall 2009 for a variety of smartphones, adding new features like support for CDMA smartphones, support for additional screen sizes and a text-to-speech engine.
Donut followed an earlier update for Android – Cupcake (v1.5) – and has since been superseded by more recent Android updates Eclair (v2.0), FroYo (v2.2), Gingerbread (v2.3), Honeycomb (v3.0) and the upcoming Ice Cream Sandwich (v4.0) update.
See also Android platform, Android SDK and Android codenames.

dooce
(v.) To lose ones job (fired) because of something you have publicly posted in a blog. The most common usage of the word is  dooced (eg. she was dooced). The word dooced was coined in 2002 by Heather Armstrong, a Los Angeles Web designer who lost her job after writing about work colleagues in her personal blog, dooce.com.

doorway
(dōr´wā) (n.) Also referred to as a doorway page, a jump page, an entry page or a bridge page. A Web page designed specifically for the purpose of gaining high placement in a search engine��s rankings. An SEO technique, the doorway is meant to capture the attention of a search engine��s spider by containing keywords and phrases that the spider will pick up on. Often the doorway page contains hidden text in order to load the page with occurrences of a specific keyword or phrase. Doorways typically are programmed with a fast meta refresh or a redirect that brings the user to the page that the Web site actually wants the user to visit, or the doorway will have a way for the user to manually click through to the next site. Some search engines are wary of doorway pages and penalize sites that use them. For example, read Google��s opinion of doorway pages.May also be called a gateway page.

dope
To add elements into a semiconductor material during the manufacturing process to increase its conductivity. The impurities added are called dopants. Common dopants include arsenic, antimony, bismuth and phosphorous.  The type and level of doping determines whether the semiconductor is N-type (current is conducted by excess free electrons) or P-type (current is conducted by electron vacancies).  

doppelblogger
Slang term used to describe a blogger who plagiarizes the content of another blogger.
 
See  The History of Blogging in the  Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

dorkbot
A family of malware worms that typically spreads through instant messaging, USB removable drives, websites or social media channels like Facebook and Twitter. Downloading and installing Dorkbot malware results in it opening a backdoor on infected computers, allowing for remote access and potentially turning the computer into a botnet.

The Dorkbot worm gained publicity in late 2011 for an attack on Facebook’s chat system, with users receiving a message with a bogus link that appeared to come from one of their Facebook friends.  A similar Dorkbot worm appeared later in the same year, this time preying on Twitter users.

DOS
(1) Acronym for disk operating system. The term DOS can refer to any operating system, but it is most often used as a shorthand for MS-DOS (Microsoft disk operating system). Originally developed by Microsoft for IBM, MS-DOS was the standard operating system for IBM-compatible personal computers.
The initial versions of DOS were very simple and resembled another operating system called CP/M. Subsequent versions have became increasingly sophisticated as they incorporated features of minicomputer operating systems. However, DOS is still a 16-bit operating system and does not support multiple users or multitasking.
For some time, it has been widely acknowledged that DOS is insufficient for modern computer applications. Microsoft Windows helped alleviate some problems, but still, it sat on top of DOS and relied on DOS for many services. Even Windows 95 sat on top of DOS. Newer operating systems, such as Windows NT and OS/2 Warp, do not rely on DOS to the same extent, although they can execute DOS-based programs. It is expected that as these operating systems gain market share, DOS will eventually disappear. In the meantime, Caldera, Inc. markets a version of DOS called DR-OpenDOSthat extends MS-DOS in significant ways.

DoS_attack
Short for denial-of-service attack, a type of attack on a network that is designed to bring the network to its knees by flooding it with useless traffic. Many DoS attacks, such as the Ping of Death and Teardrop attacks, exploit limitations in the TCP/IP protocols. For all known DoS attacks, there are software fixes that system administrators can install to limit the damage caused by the attacks. But, like viruses, new DoS attacks are constantly being dreamed up by hackers.
 
 

DOS_Protected_Mode_Interface
Created for Windows version 3.0, DPMI is an industry standard for an interface that allows DOS applications to access extended memory of the 80286-, 80386-, and 80486-based PC architecture while maintaining system protection. 

dot_pitch
Also called phosphor pitch, a measurement that indicates the diagonal distance between like-colored phosphor dots on a display screen. Measured in millimeters, the dot pitch is one of the principal characteristics that determines the quality of display monitors. The lower the number, the crisper the image. The dot pitch of color monitors for personal computers ranges from about 0.15 mm to 0.30 mm. 

dot_matrix_printer
A type of printer that produces characters and illustrations by striking pins against an ink ribbon to print closely spaced dots in the appropriate shape. Dot-matrix printers are relatively expensive and do not produce high-quality output. However, they can print to multi-page forms (that is, carbon copies), something laser and ink-jet printers cannot do.
Dot-matrix printers vary in two important characteristics:

speed: Given in characters per second  (cps),the speed can vary from about 50 to over 500 cps. Most dot-matrix printers offer different speeds depending on the quality of print desired.
print quality: Determined by the number of pins (the mechanisms that print the dots), it can vary from 9 to 24. The best dot-matrix printers (24 pins) can produce near letter-quality type, although you can still see a difference if you look closely.

In addition to these characteristics, you should also consider the noise factor. Compared to laser and ink-jet printers, dot-matrix printers are notorious for making a racket.

DOT4
A protocol that enables the devices that comprise an MFP to send and receive data packets to each other across a single physical channel at the same time. The protocol was specified by IEEE 1284.4, which is an enhancement to the IEEE 1284 protocol for parallel port computing.

DOTBAM
Acronym for DOT (as in DOT-COM) Brick And Mortar.  DOTBAM refers to the online division or group of a traditional brick-and-mortar store. DOTBAMs are also called  click-and-mortars.

double_click
Tapping a mouse button twice in rapid succession. Note that the second click must immediately follow the first, otherwise the program will interpret them as two separate clicks rather than one double click.  In Microsoft Windows and the Macintosh interface, you can use a double click to open files and applications. Both systems let you set the double-click speed (the longest acceptable interval between each click).  

double_precision
Refers to a type of floating-point number that has more precision (that is, more digits to the right of the decimal point) than a single-precision number. The term double precision is something of a misnomer because the precision is not really double. The word double derives from the fact that a double-precision number uses twice as many bits as a regular floating-point number. For example, if a single-precision number requires 32 bits, its double-precision counterpart will be 64 bits long.  The extra bits increase not only the precision but also the range of magnitudes that can be represented. The exact amount by which the precision and range of magnitudes are increased depends on what format the program is using to represent floating-point values. Most computers use a standard format known as the IEEE  floating-point format.   

double_density_disk
A floppy disk that has twice the storage capacity of a single-density floppy. Single-density disks are now obsolete. Double-density 5¼-inch disks for PCs can hold 360K of data. Double-density 3½-inch disks can hold 720K. 

double_post
In online forums double posting is when a user posts the same message or slightly edited versions of the message more than once, in more than on discussion thread. Double-post is also called cross-post.

double_sided_disk
A floppy disk with both sides prepared for recording data. You can store twice as much data on a double-sided disk, but you need to use a double-sided disk drive. All modern disks and disk drives are double-sided. 

down
Not working. A computer system is said to be down when it is not available to users. This can occur because it is broken (that is, it has crashed), or because it has been made temporarily unavailable to users so that routine servicing can be performed.  

down_converter
In satellite communications, down converter is a device for fixed satellite service (FSS) television receivers to convert 4-GHz signals to the 70-MHz frequency range.

downconversion
In digital television, downconversion is the process where a high-definition signal is converted to a standard-definition picture to be displayed on a television with a lower resolution. Downconversion reduces image detail but the picture will still look quite sharp. Contrast with upconversion.

downlink
In satellite communications, downlink is the establishment of a communications link from an orbiting satellite down to one or more ground stations on Earth.  Contrast with uplink.

download
To copy data (usually an entire file) from a main source to a peripheral device. The term is often used to describe the process of copying a file from an online service or bulletin board service  (BBS) to one's own computer. Downloading can also refer to copying a file from a network file server to a computer on the network.
In addition, the term is used to describe the process of loading a font into a laser printer. The font is first copied from a disk to the printer's local memory. A font that has been downloaded like this is called a soft font to distinguish it from the hard  fontsthat are permanently in the printer's memory.
The opposite of download is upload, which means to copy a file from your own computer to another computer.

downstream
(adj.) A transmission from a server to an end user. A downstream transmission can be in the form of a signal being transmitted from a server to a workstation across a network, such as a LAN, or a signal being sent from a cable service provider to a customer. A transmission from an end user to a server is referred to as upstream.

doxing
Doxing is the process of gathering information about a person or business using online public sources such as social media profiles, reverse phone lookup and search engines. The information doxed may include a person's full name, email address, address, telephone number, pictures and other personal details. Doxing typically leads to an anonymous person's identity being revealed.
Recommended Reading: Webopedia's Google Dorking definition.
Why People Get Doxed
In some cases, a person is doxed simply because another person wants to learn more about them. There are also instances where a person is maliciously doxed and will find all their personal information has been collected and posted online in one place. A personal dox may be compiled for retaliation or vigilantism or used to threaten, blackmail or harass a victim.

DP
DP is an abbreviation that is used to mean the following:
(1) Short for data processing (2) Short for dual-processor (3) Short for Distribution Point.

dpi
Abbreviation of dots per inch, which indicates the resolution of images. The more dots per inch, the higher the resolution. A common resolution for laser printers is 600 dots per inch. This means 600 dots across and 600 dots down, so there are 360,000 dots per square inch.


DPMI
Short for DOS Protected Mode Interface. 

DPMS
Short for Display Power Management Signaling, a VESA interface standard that defines four power management modes for monitors in idle state: on, stand-by, suspend and off. Using DPMS, the display controller (typically the video card or chip from which the monitor receives signals) sends a signal along two signal lines �� horizontal sync (h-sync) and vertical sync (v-sync) -- to the monitor, instructing it to enter into one of the four power management states.

draft_mode
A printing mode in which the printer prints text as fast as possible without regard to the print quality. Most dot-matrix printers support two modes: draft mode and either letter-quality (LQ) or near letter quality   (NLQ) mode. In addition, many word processors support a draft mode in which they display and print pages without all the formatting detail specified for the document.   

draft_quality
Describes print whose quality is less than near letter quality. Most 9-pin dot-matrix printers produce draft-quality print.  

drag
(1) In graphical user interfaces, drag refers to moving an icon or other image on a display screen. To drag an object across a display screen, you usually select the object with a mouse button ("grab" it) and then move the mouse while keeping the mouse button pressed down.  The term drag is also used more generally to refer to any operation in which the mouse button is held down while the mouse is moved. For example, you would drag the mouse to select a block of text.  

drag_and_drop
Describes applications that allow you to drag objects to specific locations on the screen to perform actions on them. For example, in the Macintosh environment, you can drag a document to the trashcan icon to delete it. This is a classic case of drag-and-drop functionality.  When implemented well, drag-and-drop functionality is both faster and more intuitive than alternatives, such as selecting options from a menu or typing in commands.  Modern operating systems, including Windows and the Mac OS, even allow you to drag and drop between applications. You can, for example, create a picture with a draw program, select it, and then drag it into a document that you are editing with a word processor.   

DragonBall_processor
An integrated system on a chip series of CPUs used in many smartphones and PDAs. The Motorola DragonBall processor was the original processor used in Palm PDAs.

DragonFly_BSD
DragonFly BSD is a fork of  FreeBSD 4.8 (June of 2003, by Matthew Dillon). It is based on the same class of operating system as BSD and Linux, but it takes a different direction from the FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD series. The DragonFly project focuses on rewriting most of the major kernel subsystems with a great deal of work in nearly every subsystem, particularly the filsystem APIs and kernel core. The DragonFly project provides native clustering support in the kernel. In 2007, a new filesystem called HAMMER was developed for DragonFly. This filesystem has been designed to solve numerous issues and to add many new capabilities to DragonFly, such as fine-grained snapshots, instant crash recovery, and near real-time mirroring. The filesystem is also intended to serve as a basis for the clustering work that makes up the second phase of the project.

DRAM
Pronounced dee-ram, DRAM stands for dynamic random access memory, a type of memory used in most personal computers.


draw_program
A graphics  program that enables you to draw pictures, then store the images in files, merge them into documents, and print them. Unlike paint programs, which represent images as bit maps, draw programs use vector graphics, which makes it easy to scale images to different sizes. In addition, graphics produced with a draw program have no inherent resolution. Rather, they can be represented at any resolution, which makes them ideal for high-resolution output.   

drexting
Abbreviated form of "Driving" and "texting". Drexting is a slang term that means to drive while texting.
 
See also "Text Messaging Abbreviations" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia for definitions to more than 1,000 chat abbreviations.

dribbleware
Software characterized by frequent updates, fixes, and patches. The term is somewhat derogatory, indicating software that was released without sufficient testing or before all features could be added. With the intense market pressure to release software products as soon as possible, and with the increased ease of updating software via Internet downloads, dribbleware is becoming the norm rather than the exception. 

dridex-malware
Dridex is a strain of banking malware that leverages macros in Microsoft Office to infect systems. Once a computer has been infected, Dridex attackers can steal banking credentials and other personal information on the system to gain access to the financial records of a user.
Dridex operates by first arriving on a user's computer as a malicious spam e-mail with a Microsoft Word document attached to the message. If the user opens the document, a macro embedded in the document surreptitiously triggers a download of the Dridex banking malware, enabling it to first steal banking credentials and then attempt to generate fraudulent financial transactions.
Evolving from Cridex and ZeuS
Dridex is an evolution of the Cridex malware, which itself is based on the ZeuS Trojan Horse malware. According to security firm Trustwave, the Dridex banking malware initially spread in late 2014 via a spam campaign that generated upwards of 15,000 emails each day. The attacks primarily focused on systems located in the United Kingdom.

drill_down
(v) In information technology, to move from summary information to detailed data by focusing in on something. To drill down through a series of folders, for example, on a desktop means to go through the hierarchy of folders to find a specific file or to click through drop-down menus in a GUI. To drill down through a database is to access information by starting with a general category and moving through the hierarchy of field to file to record.  (n) Spelled drilldown. The act of focusing in. For example, "He got the information he needed through a drilldown of the database."

drill_through
(v.) Drill through is a term used to describe the act of exploring or browsing items like folders, files or related components. Generally associated with drill down and drill up, which indicate vertical movements between components, drill through is an action in which you move horizontally between two items via a related link. An example to drill through is in the case of two reports that are in a master /detail relation with each other, and by clicking a master item on the master report you reach the details of the clicked item on the details report. See also drill down.

drive_bay
An area of reserved space in a personal computer where hard or floppy disk drives (or tape drives) can be installed. The number of drive bays in a computer determines the total number of internal mass storage devices it can handle.   

driver
A program that controls a device. Every device, whether it be a printer, disk drive, or keyboard, must have a driver program. Many drivers, such as the keyboard driver, come with the operating system. For other devices, you may need to load a new driver when you connect the device to your computer. In DOS systems, drivers are files with a.SYS extension. In Windows environments, drivers often have a.DRVextension.
A driver acts like a translator between the device and programs that use the device. Each device has its own set of specialized commands that only its driver knows. In contrast, most programs accessdevices by using generic commands. The driver, therefore, accepts generic commands from a program and then translates them into specialized commands for the device.


DRM
Short for digital rights management, a system for protecting the copyrights of data circulated via the Internet or other digital media by enabling secure distribution and/or disabling illegal distribution of the data. Typically, a DRM system protects intellectual property by either encrypting the data so that it can only be accessed by authorized users or marking the content with a digital watermark or similar method so that the content can not be freely distributed.Also see SSL: Your Key to E-commerce Security in Webopedia's "Did You Know...?" section.

DRM_Free
Meaning "without digital rights management". DRM-free music tracks can be purchased and downloaded online and are currently offered by the iTunes Store and Napster,  as well as other online digital music vendors. DRM-free music may be purchased cheaper than those sold under DRM, and may also be of lesser quality. Most stores offering DRM-free music will provide users with options to upgrade the the higher quality DRM version by charging a small fee.

DroidDream is a mobile botnet type of malware that appeared in spring 2011. The DroidDream Trojan gained root access to Google Android mobile devices in order to access unique identification information for the phone. Once compromised, a DroidDream-infected phone could also download additional malicious programs without the user’s knowledge as well as open the phone up to control by hackers.
DroidDream affected mobile devices running v2.2 (FroYo) and earlier versions of the Android OS operating system, and entered phones through the download and installation of one of 50+ third-party applications that were available on Google's official Android Market. Google removed the apps from its marketplace and had to utilize its "kill switch" to remotely wipe Android devices that had been infected by DroidDream.
DroidDream got its name from the fact that it was set up to run between the hours of 11pm and 8am when users were most likely to be sleeping and their phones less likely to be in use. Additional variants of DroidDream have since appeared, including DroidDream Light in June 2011 and a variant of DroidDream Light that appeared a month later.

drop_cap
In desktop publishing, the first letter of a paragraph that is enlarged to "drop" down two or more lines, as in the next paragraph. Drop caps are often seen at the beginning of novels, where the top of the first letter of the first word lines up with the top of the first sentence and drops down to the four or fifth sentence.
to the beginning of a section.


drop_frame
A type of time code designed to match the real time of clocks. Two frames of time code are dropped every minute, on the minute, except every tenth minute. This corrects for video frames that occur at a rate of 29.97 per second.

drop_the_pin
A slang term used to describe your location on Google Maps. A feature of Google Maps allows users to locate a place on a map then drop the pin icon on that area. Users can then add a title and description before saving the location in their personal "My Maps" area.

drop_down_menu
Same as pull-down menu.

dropbox
Dropbox is a free cloud storage service for sharing and storing files including photos, documents and videos. To use Dropbox you need to create an account on dropbox.com and allow the service to create folders on all your connected devices -- such as PCs, laptops or other mobile devices -- and synchronize any files you store on Dropbox with the connected devices. Files can be shared with others by providing them with a link to your Dropbox folder.
Dropbox came under fire in July 2012 when the company announced that some users received spam on email accounts that were linked solely to Dropbox accounts. As reported on Datamation, an investigation revealed that passwords stolen from other websites were used to gain access to a small number of Dropbox accounts, but the breach encouraged Dropbox to institute new procedures to improve the cloud storage platform's security.
Dropbox was launched in 2007 by Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi. Today, the service claims to have more than 50 million users. Dropbox offers free storage accounts (2GB storage space) and paid accounts for options between 50GB and 100GB of storage.

dropper
Also called a dropper program or a virus dropper, a program that when run will install a virus, Trojan horse or worm onto a hard drive, floppy disk or other memory media. The dropper itself is not a virus �� it does not replicate; instead, it��s more like a Trojan horse in that it carries the malicious code with it and is not detected by virus-scanning software because it is not an infected file but carries the code to "drop" a virus into a system. Droppers are uncommon.

DRP
Short for disaster recovery plan, DRP is a plan for business continuity in the event of a disaster that destroys part or all of a business's resources, including IT equipment, data records and the physical space of an organization.
Stages of a Disaster Recovery Plan
The goal of a DRP is to resume normal computing capabilities in as little time as possible. A typical DRP has several stages, including the following:


Understanding an organization's activities and how all of its resources are interconnected.
Assessing an organization's vulnerability in all areas, including operating procedures, physical space and equipment, data integrity and contingency planning.
Understanding how all levels of the organization would be affected in the event of a disaster.
Developing a short-term recovery plan.
Developing a long-term recovery plan, including how to return to normal business operations and prioritizing the order of functions that are resumed.
Testing and consistently maintaining and updating the plan as the business changes.

A key to a successful DRP is taking steps to preventing the likelihood of disasters from occurring, such as using a hot site or cold site to back up data archives.

Drupal
An open source content management platform that supports a variety of Web sites ranging from personal Weblogs to large community-driven Web sites. The Drupal software package can be used by individuals or a community of users to publish, manage and organize content on a Web site. The Drupal platform supports a number of features including electronic commerce, blogs, collaborative authoring environments, forums, newsletters,  podcasting, file uploads, and more. Drupal is open-source software and distributed under the GPL ("GNU General Public License").

DSDL
Short for Double Sided Dual Layer DVD.See dual layer.

DSI
Short for delivered source instruction, one line of new source code developed for software. DSI is used to estimate software cost (see COCOMO).  Typically expressed in thousands of lines of code (e.g., 2,000 DSI or 2KDSI).

DSLAM
Short for Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer, a mechanism at a phone company's central location that links many customer DSL connections to a single high-speed ATMline.
When the phone company receives a DSL signal, an ADSL modem with a POTS splitter detects voice calls and data. Voice calls are sent to the PSTN, and data are sent to the DSLAM, where it passes through the ATM to the Internet, then back through the DSLAM and ADSL modem before returning to the customer's PC.
More DSLAMs a phone company has, the more customers it can support.

DSML
Directory Service Markup Language combines directory services technology (LDAP ) with XML syntax to provide an easy way to share and use personalized data across company and technology boundaries.   The DSML effort was announced by creator Bowstreet on July 12, 1999. Initiative supporters include AOL-Netscape, Sun Microsystems, Oracle, Novell, Microsoft, and IBM. 

DSN
Short for Data Source Name. Data Source Name provides connectivity to a database through an ODBC driver. The DSN contains database name, directory, database driver, UserID, password, and other information. Once you create a DSN for a particular database, you can use the DSN in an application to call information from the database.
There are three types of DSNs: (1) System DSN -- can be used by anyone who has access to the machine. DSN info is stored in the registry. (2) User DSN -- created for a specific user. Also stored in the registry. (3) File DSN-- DSN info is stored in a text file with .DSN extension.
DSN is often used by Active Server Pages (ASP) and Visual Basic programs when a query to a database is necessary to retrieve information.

DSOM
Short for Distributed System Object Model, a version of SOM that supports sharing binary objects across networks. DSOM is similar to Microsoft's competing standard called DCOM.  

DSP
Short for digital signal processing, which refers to manipulating analog information, such as sound or photographs that has been converted into a digital form. DSP also implies the use of a data compression technique.
When used as a noun, DSP stands for digital signal processor, a special type of coprocessor designed for performing the mathematics involved in DSP. Most DSPs are programmable, which means that they can be used for manipulating different types of information, including sound, images, and video.

DSR
Short for Detailed Seller Ratings, on eBay DSR is the part of the feedback system that allows buyers to leave detailed ratings for the seller on four aspects of a transaction. These four areas available for comment and ratings include the following:   Item as described Communication Shipping time Shipping and handling charges  In  DSR the rating system is based on a one to five-star scale with five stars being the highest rating and one star being the lowest rating. 

DSSL
Short for Double Sided Single Layer DVD.  See dual layer. See also DVD.

DSSS
Acronym for direct-sequence spread spectrum. DSSS is one of two types of spread spectrum radio, the other being frequency-hopping spread spectrum. DSSS is a transmission technology used in LAWNtransmissions where a data signal at the sending station is combined with a higher data rate bit sequence, or chipping code, that divides the user data according to a spreading ratio. The chipping code is a redundant bit pattern for each bit that is transmitted, which increases the signal's resistance to interference. If one or more bits in the pattern are damaged during transmission, the original data can be recovered due to the redundancy of the transmission.

DSSSL
Short for Document Style Semantics and Specification Language, DSSSL is an ISO standard that provides standardized syntax and standardized semantics to specify style and layout for SGML documents. Using DSSSL enables a publisher to specify the style for an element or attribute, interchange that style specification, and reproduce that style within certain limitations. The Document Style Semantics and Specification Language (DSSSL), became international standard in April 1996.

DSTN
Short for double-layer supertwist nematic, a passive-matrix LCD technology that uses two display layers to counteract the color shifting that occurs with conventional supertwist displays. 

DSTP
Short for Data Space Transfer Protocol, a protocol used to index and categorize data using a XML -based catalogue.   Data, no matter how it is stored (e.g. file, type of file, database, or distributed database ), has corresponding XML files, which contain UCK (Universal Correlation Key) tags that act as identification keys.   Data is retrieved when a user connects to DSTP servers with a DSTP client and asks for specific information. Data is found and retrieved based on the labels contained in the UCK tags. 

DSVD
(Digital Simultaneous Voice and Data) An all-digital technology for concurrent voice and data (SVD) transmission over a single analog telephone line. DSVD is endorsed by Intel, Hayes, U.S. Robotics and others and has been submitted to the ITU for possible standardization. DSVD modems became available in the first half of 1995.  

DTCP_IP
(pronounced as separate letters) Short for Digital Transmission Content Protection over Internet Protocol, a specification for copy protection of copyrighted content that is transferred over digital interfaces in home networks that adhere to IP. Under this specification, digital content can be shared securely between devices in a user��s home but not shared with third-parties outside the home network. Using an authentication scheme, DTCP-IP allows the user to designate devices in the home network as trusted destinations that can transfer data back and forth, but DTCP-IP will not allow the content to be transmitted over the Internet to be shared outside of the home network.  DTCP-IP was developed jointly by Intel, Toshiba, Hitachi, Sony, and Panasonic.

DTD
Short for document type definition. A DTD states what tags and attributes are used to describe content in an SGML, XML or HTML document, where each tag is allowed, and which tags can appear within other tags. For example, in a DTD one could say that LIST tags can contain ITEM tags, but ITEM tags cannot contain LIST tags. In some editors, when authors are inputting information, they can place tags only where the DTD allows. This ensures that all the documentation is formatted the same way. Applications will use a document's DTD to properly read and display a document's contents. Changes in the format of the document can be easily made by modifying the DTD.  (Special thanks goes to technical writer Ryan Mauldin for help in updating this definition.)

DTE
Short for Data Terminal Equipment, a device that controls data flowing to or from a computer. The term is most often used in reference to serial communications defined by the RS-232C standard. This standard defines the two ends of the communications channel as being a DTE and Data Communications Equipment (DCE) device. In practical terms, the DCE is usually a modem and the DTE is the computer itself, or more precisely, the computer's UART chip. For internal modems, the DCE and DTE are part of the same device.


DTMF
Short for Dual Tone Multi-Frequency, the system used by touch-tone telephones. DTMF assigns a specific frequency (consisting of two separate tones) to each key so that it can easily be identified by a microprocessor.  

Disruption_Tolerant_Networking
Abbreviated as DTN, Disruption Tolerant Networking is a networking architecture that is designed to provide communications in the most unstable and stressed environments, where the network would normally be subject to frequent and long lasting disruptions and high bit error rates that could severely degrade normal communications. It is an experimental protocol developed by the Delay & Disruption Tolerant Networking Research Group, which operates under the Internet Research Task Force.
A Different Approach to TCP/IP
DTN works using different kind of approach than TCP/IP for packet delivery that is more resilient to disruption than TCP/IP. DTN is based on a new experimental protocol called the Bundle Protocol (RFC 5050). The Bundle Protocol (BP) sits at the application layer of some number of constituent internets, forming a store-and-forward overlay network. BP operates as an overlay protocol that links together multiple subnets (such as Ethernet-based LANs) into a single network.
Store-And-Forward
The basic idea behind DTN network is that endpoints aren't always continuously connected. In order to facilitate data transfer, DTN uses a store-and-forward approach across routers that is more disruption-tolerant than TCP/IP. However, the DTN approach doesn't necessarily mean that all DTN routers on a network would require large storage capacity in order to maintain end-to-end data integrity.

DTS
(1) Short for Digital Theater Sound, it is a  multichannel  surround sound format used in both commercial and consumer applications. DTS was created by the company for which the technology was named, Digital Theater Systems (which is now called DTS Inc.). DTS is a competing technology with Dolby Digital.  (2) Short for Data Transformation Services, a set of tools available in Microsoft SQL Server that lets you extract, transform, and consolidate data from disparate sources into single or multiple destinations supported by DTS connectivity. By using DTS tools to graphically build DTS  packages or by programming a package with the DTS object model, you can create custom data movement solutions tailored to the specialized business needs of your organization.

DTS_Inc
DTS, Inc. is a digital technology company dedicated to delivering the ultimate entertainment experience. DTS decoders are in virtually every major brand of 5.1-channel surround processors, and there are more than 300 million DTS-licensed consumer electronics products available worldwide. A pioneer in multi-channel audio, DTS technology is in home theatre, car audio, PC and game console products, as well as DVD-Video, Surround Music and DVD-ROM software, and Circle Surround.

DTS_ES
Short for Digital Theater Sound - Extended Surround. It is a 6.1 matrixed system enabling cinemas to deliver extreme spatial effects that literally surround the audience. A rack-mounting DTS-ES decoder creates a back surround channel from encoded surround tracks, in typical theatre applications feeding a back surround (BS) speaker array (configured as left-back-wall and right-back-wall for stereo operation). The system is compatible with all current extended surround formats and an auxiliary surround channel is also provided for other applications. ES modes can be selected via automation inputs or via the built in DTS timecode reader, which detects ES serial numbers for automatic DTS-ES playback. Star Wars: Episode I was the first of a number of films using an additional rear channel routed to the array of speakers along the back wall of a cinema. In the cinemas, this back channel is not a discrete channel, but is matrixed into the left and right surround channels, much as the center front channel was matrixed into the left and right front channels in earlier matrix optical surround formats. 

DTV
Short for Digital Television, it is a digital television standard that is fast replacing analog (or NTSC analog) television. DTV enables broadcasters to offer television with movie-quality picture and sound. It also offers greater multicasting and interactive capabilities.  While many use the terms Digital Television (DTV) and High-definition Television (HDTV) interchangeably, they are, in fact, two different things. DTV refers to the actual TV signal being transmitted digitally (instead of as an analog signal). DTV offers several broadcast options, two of which are considered to be HDTV formats. Some of the more common DTV standards include:   480i:   -the digital version of current analog signals.   480p: - provides a sharper image and looks closer to HDTV than regular television. Today all DVDs can be played on EDTV.  720p: - provides an image close in quality to 1080i, but allows 480p signals to be broadcast as well.   1080i: - the most detailed HDTV image available from broadcast TV  The numbers above represent the vertical resolution, while the letters represent interlaces or progressive scan (i) (p). For example, 1080i represents 1080 vertical resolution, interlaced. For more information on the complete list of current DTV standards, you can visit the ATSC Web site listed in the links section below. A U.S. Senate panel has set an April 7, 2009, as the deadline for television stations to switch entirely from analog to digital broadcasts. Analog televisions will work until all analog broadcasting ceases. Once the transition to complete DTV has taken place, a converter will be required to receive DTV signals and change them to the analog format of these older types of televisions. However, these DTV-to-analog converters will not produce true DTV quality.

dual_boot
Also called a multiboot, an operating system configuration that enables the user to boot the computer system from one of two different operating systems that are both installed on the same hard drive. The operating system that is loaded is given control, typically through a boot management program that will override the original MBR and load instead of an operating system.

dual_head_card
A type of dual monitor system in which a single video card uses a single chipset to drive two display devices at the same time on one system. The technology was pioneered by Matrox Graphics Inc., with the technology first appearing in the Matrox G400 line of graphics cards in 1999. DualHead is sometimes spelled dual-head.

dual_layer
Dual layer refers to a DVD recording technology that provides users with 8.5-GB of recording space (as opposed to 4.7GB of space) on a standard DVD+R discs). The additional recording space is the direct result of dual layer technology. As the name suggests, dual layer technology provides two individual recordable layers on a single sided DVD disc. To take advantage of dual layer technology when recording DVDs, you must use a dual layer enabled DVD burner and dual layer DVD media. Dual layer technology media can be read (once recorded) by most DVD drives and players currently on the market. Dual layer technology has been used for many years in the production of commercial DVD movies but is now available for home and business recording as well.
Dual Layer is more commonly called Double Layer in the consumer market, and can be seen written as DVD+R DL or DVD-R DL on recordable DVD media and hardware packaging.

dual_monitor
A computer system with more than one display connected. Dual monitor systems consist of adding additional video adapters (also called video cards) to it, or by using a single video card that has multiple ports for monitors (called a dual head card). The second display screen can be any display, such as a television, projector, or monitor. Also called a multi-monitor.

dual_core
Dual-core refers to a CPU that includes two complete execution cores per physical processor. It has combined two processors and their caches and cache controllers onto a single integrated circuit (silicon chip). Dual-core processors are well-suited for  multitasking environments because there are two complete execution cores instead of one, each with an independent interface to the frontside bus. Since each core has its own cache, the operating systemhas sufficient resources to handle most compute intensive tasks in parallel.
Multi-core is similar to dual-core in that it is an expansion to the dual-core technology which allows for more than two separate processors.
Also see  All About Dual-Core Processors  in Webopedia's "Did You Know...?" section.

dual_homed_host
A dual-homed host is a term used to reference a type of firewall that uses two (or more) network interfaces. One connection is an internal network and the second connection is to the Internet. A dual-homed host works as a simple firewall provided there is no direct IP traffic between the Internet and the internal network. See also multihomed.

dual_mode_device
In mobile computing, a dual-mode device is one that offers voice and data connectivity to both Wi-Fi and cellular communications within in a single device. Dual-mode devices enable mobile workers to carry fewer devices using converged voice and data applications.

dual_processor
Dual-processor (DP) systems are those which contains two separate physical computer processors in the same chassis. In dual-processor systems the two processors can either be located on the same motherboard or on separate boards.

dual_ring_topology
A network topology in which two concentric rings connect each node on a network instead of one network ring that is used in a ring topology. Typically, the secondary ring in a dual-ring topology is redundant. It is used as a backup in case the primary ring fails. In these configurations, data moves in opposite directions around the rings. Each ring is independent of the other until the primary ring fails and the two rings are connected to continue the flow of data traffic.

dual_scan_display
A type of passive-matrix LCD display that provides faster refresh rates that conventional passive-matrix displays by dividing the screen into two sections that are refreshed simultaneously. Dual-scan displays are not as sharp or bright as active-matrix displays, but they consume less power.  

dub
(1) A duplicate copy of an original videotape or disc. (2) In video production, dubbing is the process of recording or rerecording voices over the originals.

dumb_terminal
A display monitor that has no processing capabilities. A dumb terminal is simply an output device that accepts data from the CPU. In contrast, a smart terminal is a monitor that has its own processor for special features, such as bold and blinking characters. Dumb terminals are not as fast as smart terminals, and they do not support as many display features, but they are adequate for most applications.


dummy
A placeholder. A dummy variable , for example, is a variable that doesn't contain any useful data, but it does reserve space that a real variable will use later. 

dump
(n) The act of copying raw data from one place to another with little or no formatting for readability. Usually, dump refers to copying data from main memory to a display screen or a printer. Dumps are useful for diagnosing bugs. After a program fails, you can study the dump and analyze the contents of memory at the time of the failure. Dumps are usually output in a difficult-to-read form (that is, binary, octal, or hexadecimal), so a dump will not help you unless you know exactly what to look for.  (v) To output an image of computer memory.  

duotone
In printing terminology, duotone is a halftone picture that is composed of two printed colors.

duplexer
(doo´pleks-er) (n.) A component of a printer that allows for both sides of a page to be printed at the same time. The duplexer typically comes as an add-on accessory to a printer and attaches to the printer to allow for double-sided simultaneous printing.  A printer with a duplexer installed often is referred to as a duplex printer.

duplicate_content
In SEO (search engine optimization) terminology, it is content (or text) that has been copied or reused from other Web pages. Duplicate content is often used to help boost keyword density, however some search engines, including Google, filters duplicate text and may penalize your site, resulting in a lower keyphrase position, when you use duplicate content. An example of duplicate content would be a Web page that offers a "printer friendly" version of content, or a news aggregation Web page that copies news headlines and content from stories from other sources online without making changes to the text.
See also content page. Contrast with fresh content.

duty_cycle
(1) In  print and copy terminology, duty cycle refers to the number of copies or prints that the device can reliably produce on a monthly basis. Exceeding the duty cycle number on a regular basis can lead to equipment malfunctions and breakdowns over time. Alternatively, not printing or copying in numbers close to the duty cycle could mean you have over-purchased on equipment. (2) In time measurement, duty cycle is defined as the ratio of the duration of the phenomenon in a given period to the period, where duty cycle is abbreviated as D. In electronics, for example the duty cycle would refer to the period of time in which the device operates without negative effects (e.g. the period of time a power supply would run without overheating). (3) In RF (radio frequency) the duty cycle, also called the duty factor, is the measure of the fraction of the time a radar is transmitting.

DV_converter
In video editing, a DV (digital video) converter is a software utility that enables you to convert DV (Digital Video) to other formats including MP3, WAV, WMA, AVI, WMV, DivX, Xvid. Alternatively, you can also convert the alternative formats to DV.

Also called MHP (Multimedia Home Platform), MHP is the standard that specifies an application execution environment for digital interactive TV.  MHP is independent of vendor-specific hardware and software. The standard also defines the form in which applications are delivered at the receiver, including service information that signals interactive applications are present in the transport stream. The DVB specifications include an API, download mechanisms for applications and software functions.  DVB-MHP was designed and maintained by the DVB project.See also DVB

DVB_SH
Short for Digital Video Broadcasting - Satellite services to Handhelds.  DVB-SH is a system used to deliver IP based media content and data to handheld terminals, like mobile phones or PDAs, via satellite. The DVB-SH system was designed for frequencies below 3 GHz, typically in the S-band. DVB-SH includes features such as turbo coding for forward error correction an advanced system that is designed to cope with the hybrid satellite/terrestrial network topology.  The DVB-SH specifications are published by the DVB Project.  DVB-SH specifies two operational modes:   SH-A: specifies the use of COFDM on both satellite and terrestrial links with the possibility of running both links in SFN mode.  SH-B: uses a Time Division Multiplex (TDM) on satellite with COFDM on the terrestrial link.   See also DVB.

DVD
Short for digital versatile disc or digital video disc,  a type of optical disk technology similar to the CD-ROM. A DVD holds a minimum of 4.7GBof data, enough for a full-length movie. DVDs are commonly used as a medium for digital representation of movies and other multimedia presentations that combine sound with graphics.
The DVD specification supports disks with capacities of from 4.7GB to 17GB and access rates of 600KBps to 1.3 MBps. One of the best features of DVD drives is that they are backward-compatible with CD-ROMs, meaning they can play old CD-ROMs, CD-I disks, and video CDs, as well as new DVD-ROMs. Newer DVD players can also read CD-R disks.
DVD uses MPEG-2 to compress videodata.

DVD_authoring
The term used to describe the process of creating a DVD. Authoring includes tasks such as creating the DVD navigation structure, laying out the assets, designing the DVD menus, final production and more.

DVD_file_system

The DVD-Video files must be no larger than 1 GB in size and be recorded as a single extent in one continuous sequence. The first directory on the disc must be the VIDEO_TS directory containing all the files, and all filenames must be in the 8.3 (filename.ext) format. [Source: Burn World]

DVD_VR
DVD Video Recording, or DVD VR format, is a DVD recording format that enables you to produce a DVD movie that can be edited directly to the disc (without needing to import the video content back to your computer). DVD VR formats allow you to add new video, change menus, add chapters, split clip, remove video segments and more. DVD VR technologies are mainly available on high-end home DVD recorders. DVD VR formats:  DVD+VR (for use with DVD+RW disks) DVD-VR (for use with DVD-RAM and DVD-RW disks) 

DVD_plus_R
Short for DVD+Recordable, a recordable DVD format similar to CD-R. A DVD+R can only record data once and then the data becomes permanent on the disc. The disc can not be recorded onto a second time. DVD+R and DVD+RW formats are supported by Philips, Sony, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Ricoh, Yamaha and others.  For comparison and contrast, see DVD, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, and DVD-RAM.  Also see DVD Formats Explained in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia.

DVD_plus_RW
Short for DVD+ReWritable, a re-recordable DVD format similar to CD-RW. The data on a DVD+RW disc can be erased and recorded over numerous times without damaging the medium. DVD+RW and DVD+R formats are supported by Philips, Sony, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Ricoh, Yamaha and others.  For comparison and contrast, see DVD, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, and DVD-RAM.  Also see DVD Formats Explained in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia.

DVD_Audio
Abbreviated as DVD-A, DVD-Audio is is a DVD format designed to hold audio data, usually high-quality music, similar in nature to how DVD-Video works. The DVD-A format can hold limited data such as notes and images in addition to the audio data. DVD-A offers 24-bit/192kHz (stereo) or 24-bit/96kHz (5.1) sound, compared to16-bit/44 kHz for Audio-CDs.  Depending on the number of layers used, DVD-Audio discs can hold between 4 and 18GB of audio data. It is expected that DVD-Audio will eventually replace CD audio. Currently DVD-Audio discs are unusable in most regular DVD-Video players, the player must be a Universal DVD player or one that displays the DVD-Audio logo. DVD-Audio standards are set by the DVD Forum.

DVD_D
A disposable DVD format that provides a limited time play duration of up to 48 hours after the packaging has been opened. After the designated time has passed, DVD players are unable to read the disc. The packaging of the disc is airtight and the DVD itself has a special coating that begins to deteriorate when exposed to air. The DVD-D format is currently being used for video game and movie rentals where not only can intellectual property rights be better protected, but consumers have no need to worry about the hassle of DVD rental returns. According to the manufacturer's Web site, both the DVD-D disc and the cardboard packaging it comes in can be recycled. The DVD-D format was developed by German company FDD Technologies AG, and while no official definition of the D has been offered, many use the abbreviation to mean DVD-Destroy or DVD-Destruct.  Also see "DVD Formats Explained" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia. 

DVD_MP3
A DVD that is created with and contains only digital audio files in the MP3 format. Not all DVD players can play DVD-MP3 discs.

DVD_R
Short for Short for DVD-Recordable, a recordable DVD format similar to CD-R. A DVD-R can only record data once and then the data becomes permanent on the disc. The disc can not be recorded onto a second time. There also are two additional standards for DVD-R disks: DVD-RG for general use, and DVD-RA for authoring, which is used for mastering DVD video or data and is not typically available to the general public. DVD-R, DVD-RW and DVD-RAM are supported by Panasonic, Toshiba, Apple Computer, Hitachi, NEC, Pioneer, Samsung and Sharp. These formats are also supported by the DVD Forum.  For comparison and contrast, see DVD, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW, and DVD-RAM.  Also see DVD Formats Explained in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia.

DVD_RAM
A DVD format wherein DVD-RAM discs can be recorded and erased repeatedly but are only compatible with devices manufactured by the companies that support the DVD-RAM format. DVD-RAM discs are typically housed in cartridges. DVD-R, DVD-RW and DVD-RAM are supported by Panasonic, Toshiba, Apple Computer, Hitachi, NEC, Pioneer, Samsung and Sharp. These formats are also supported by the DVD Forum.  For comparison and contrast, see DVD, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, and DVD+R.  Also see DVD Formats Explained in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia.

DVD_ROM
A new type of read-only compact disc that can hold a minimum of 4.7GB (gigabytes), enough for a full-length movie.
The DVD-ROM specification supports disks with capacities of from 4.7GB to 17GB and access rates of 600 KBps to 1.3 MBps. One of the best features of DVD-ROM drives is that they are backward-compatible with CD-ROMs. This means that DVD-ROM players can play old CD-ROMs, CD-I disks, and video CDs, as well as new DVD-ROMs. Newer DVD players can also read CD-R disks.
DVD-ROMs use MPEG-2 to compress video data.

DVD_RW
Short for DVD-ReWritable, a re-recordable DVD format similar to CD-RW or DVD+RW. The data on a DVD-RW disc can be erased and recorded over numerous times without damaging the medium. DVD-R, DVD-RW and DVD-RAM are supported by Panasonic, Toshiba, Apple Computer, Hitachi, NEC, Pioneer, Samsung and Sharp. These formats are also supported by the DVD Forum.  For comparison and contrast, see DVD, DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD+RW, and DVD-RAM.  Also see DVD Formats Explained in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia.

DVD_SVCD
DVD-SVCD is not a valid DVD standard, since the DVD standard does not support the SVCD resolution. The term DVD-SVCD is used to describe a hacked, or non-standard DVD-Video disc that has SVCD compatible content on it.

DVD_TV_combo
Generally refers to a small television unit with a built-in DVD player. See also combo drive.

DVD_VCD
DVD-VCD, is the term most often used to describe a  DVD-Video disc that has data on it that has been  encoded by using the MPEG-1  video format with same definitions VCD has, such as the same resolution, bitrates etc. [Adapted from AfterDawn] 

DVD_VHS_combo
A DVD-VHS combo is a multi-format recorder that enables users to copy VHS to DVD within a single device. Depending on the recorder supported formats include the  DVD-R/-RW format or DVD+R/+RW. DVDs created on a DVD-VHS combo will play in most DVD players.See also combo drive.

DVD_Video
A video format for displaying full-length digital movies. A number of manufacturers are just beginning to sell DVD-Video players, which attach to a television just like a videocassette player. Unlike DVD-ROMs, the Digital-Video format includes a Content Scrambling System (CSS) to prevent users from copying discs. This means that today's DVD-ROM players cannot play DVD-Video discs without a software or hardware upgrade to decode the encrypted discs. 

DVD10
(pronounced as separate letters) A double-sided, single layer DVD that can hold 8.75GB of audio and video data. It is supported by DVD+R/RW and DVD-R/RW.

DVD18
(pronounced as separate letters) A double-sided, double layer DVD that can hold 15.9GB of audio and video data. It is supported by DVD+R/RW format.

DVD5
(pronounced as separate letters) (n.) A single-sided, single layer DVD that can hold up to 4.7GB (120 minutes) of high quality audio and video data. All DVDs are made from two substrates that are bonded together, and the second substrate on a DVD5 is a data-less layer that does not contain any pits.

DVD9
(pronounced as separate letters) (n.) A single-sided, dual-layer DVD that can hold 8.54GB (or fours hours) of audio and video data. It should be noted that DVD-RW and DVD+RW do not support DVD9.

DVI
(pronounced as separate letters) (1) Short for Digital Visual Interface, a digital interface standard created by the Digital Display Working Group (DDWG) to convert analog signals into digital signals to accommodate both analog and digital monitors. Data is transmitted using the transition minimized differential signaling (TMDS) protocol, providing a digital signal from the PC's graphics subsystem to the display. The standard specifies a single plug and connector that encompass both the new digital and legacy VGA interfaces, as well as a digital-only plug connector. DVI handles bandwidths in excess of 160 MHz and thus supports UXGA and HDTV with a single set of links. Higher resolutionscan be supported with a dual set of links.
(2) Short for Digital Video Interactive, a now-defunct technology developed by General Electric that enables a computer to store and display moving video images like those on television. The most difficult aspect of displaying TV-like images on a computer is overcoming the fact that each frame requires an immense amount of storage. A single frame can require up to 2MB (megabytes) of storage. Televisions display 30 frames per second, which can quickly exhaust a computer's mass storage resources. It is also difficult to transfer so much data to a display screenat a rate of 30 frames per second.
DVI overcomes these problems by using specialized processors to compress and decompress the data. DVI is a hardware -only codec (compression/decompression) technology. A competing hardware codec, which has become much more popular, is MPEG. Intel has developed a software version of the DVI algorithms, which it markets under the name Indeo.

DVI_to_VGA_adapter
A DVI to VGA adapter is used to connect a VGA/SVGA monitor to a DVI-I connection. These adapters are commonly used by those with an older video cards and a newer LCD display.

DVI_I
Short for DVI (Digital Visual Interface)  Integrated, DVI-I is the connection, or interface used between monitors and computers or home theater systems. DVI-I is used to interface with an LCD or CRT monitor display for digital video output. DVI-I supports both digital and analog. However, it will not use both at the same time. DVI-I detects and chooses digital or analog depending on the connected display. Contrast with DVI-D, which is a digital-only interface and DVI-A which is an analog-only interface.See also DVI.

DVMRP
Short for Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol, an interior gateway protocol based on RIP that supports connectionless multicast data transmission to a group of hosts over a network. DVMRP tunnels multicast transmission within unicast packets that are reassembled into multicast data when they arrive at their destination.

Dvorak_keyboard
)A keyboard designed for speed typing. The Dvorak keyboard was designed in the 1930s by August Dvorak, a professor of education, and his brother-in-law, William Dealy. Unlike the traditional QWERTY keyboard, the Dvorak keyboard is designed so that the middle row of keys includes the most common letters. In addition, common letter combinations are positioned in such a way that they can be typed quickly.
It has been estimated that in an average eight-hour day, a typist's hands travel 16 miles on a QWERTY keyboard, but only 1 mile on a Dvorak keyboard.
In addition to the standard Dvorak keyboard, there are two additional Dvorak keyboards, a left-handed and right-handed keyboard. These keyboards are designed for people who have only one hand for typing.

DWDM
Short for Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing, an optical technology used to increase bandwidth over existing fiber optic backbones.
DWDM works by combining and transmitting multiple signals simultaneously at different wavelengths on the same fiber. In effect, one fiber is transformed into multiple virtual fibers. So, if you were to multiplex eight OC-48 signals into one fiber, you would increase the carrying capacity of that fiber from 2.5 Gb/s to 20 Gb/s. Currently, because of DWDM, single fibers have been able to transmit data at speeds up to 400Gb/s.
A key advantage to DWDM is that it's protocol- and bit-rate-independent. DWDM-based networks can transmit data in IP, ATM, SONET /SDH, and Ethernet, and handle bit rates between 100 Mb/s and 2.5 Gb/s. Therefore, DWDM-based networks can carry different types of traffic at different speeds over an optical channel.

dweet
Slang term used to describe a tweet (a Twitter message) send by a user who is drunk. See "Cool Twitter Tools for Better Tweeting" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia.  See also "Social Media Tips for Online Marketing Plus 30 Social Media Sites" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia.

DXF
Abbreviation of Data Exchange File, a two-dimensional graphics file format supported by virtually all PC -based CAD products. It was created by AutoDesk for the AutoCAD system.  

dynamic
Refers to actions that take place at the moment they are needed rather than in advance. For example, many programs perform dynamic memory allocation, which means that they do not reserve memory ahead of time, but seize sections of memory when needed. In general, such programs require less memory, although they may run a little more slowly. Also see dynamic HTML and dynamic URL. The opposite of dynamic is static.  

dynamic_acceleration
A feature supported by some mice drivers that causes the mouse resolution to depend on how fast the mouse is moved. When you move the mouse fast, the cursor moves proportionally further (the resolution is low). This is useful for jumping across the screen. Without this feature, you might need to sweep the mouse several times to move the cursor from one side of the display screen to the other. When you move the mouse slowly, the resolution increases to enable you to pinpoint specific pixels.  Dynamic resolution is also called ballistic tracking, automatic acceleration, variable acceleration, and dynamic acceleration.  

dynamic_aspect_oriented_programming
Dynamic aspect-oriented programming, or dynamic AOP, using wrapper technologies, offers a way of allowing components to be individually customized and extended. Dynamic aspect-oriented programming is relatively straightforward in a trusted environment, where (with the exception of bugs) aspects can be assumed to be safe. In an untrusted public computing environment, new aspects cannot be assumed to come from a benign source. * [Source:  Dynamic Aspect-Oriented Programming (PDF)]

dynamic_content
Web site or blog content that changes frequently and engages the reader, dynamic content can include animations, video or audio.

dynamic-data-structure
A dynamic data structure (DDS) refers to an organization or collection of data in memory that has the flexibility to grow or shrink in size, enabling a programmer to control exactly how much memory is utilized. Dynamic data structures change in size by having unused memory allocated or de-allocated from the heap as needed.  Dynamic data structures play a key role in programming languages like C, C++ and Java because they provide the programmer with the flexibility to adjust the memory consumption of software programs.
Dynamic Data Structures vs. Static Data Structures
Dynamic data structures stand in contrast to static data structures (SDS), wherein in the case of the latter the size of the structure is fixed. Static data structures are ideal for storing a fixed number of data items, but they lack the dynamic data structure’s flexibility to consume additional memory if needed or free up memory when possible for improved efficiency.
As a result, when the number of data items can’t be predicted beforehand, a dynamic data structure should be used. A potential drawback to using dynamic data structures, though, is that because allocation of memory isn’t fixed, there is the possibility for the structure to overflow if it exceeds the maximum allowed memory limit or underflow if the data structure becomes empty.

dynamic_disk
Supported by Windows 2000, dynamic disk is a physical disk initialized for dynamic storage. It holds simple  volumes, spanned volumes, mirrored volumes, striped volumes, and RAID-5 volumes. With a dynamic disk you can perform disk and volume management without having to restart the operating system. Upgrading a basic disk to dynamic storage will render the entire disk unreadable to operating systems other than Windows 2000. Contrast with basic disk.

dynamic_DNS
Short for dynamic Domain Name System, a method of keeping a domain name linked to a changing IP address as not all computers use static IP addresses. Typically, when a user connects to the Internet, the user's ISP assigns an unused IP address from a pool of IP addresses, and this address is used only for the duration of that specific connection. This method of dynamically assigning addresses extends the usable pool of available IP addresses. A dynamic DNS service provider uses a special program that runs on the user's computer, contacting the DNS service each time the IP address provided by the ISP changes and subsequently updating the DNS database to reflect the change in IP address. In this way, even though a domain name's IP address will change often, other users do not have to know the changed IP address in order to connect with the other computer.

dynamic_Domain_Name_System
See dynamic DNS.

Dynamic_Drive_Overlay
See DDO.

dynamic_function_loading
(dī-nam´ik funk´sh&n lōd´ing) (n.) Also known as lazy loading, the capability to specify which components of a program are called into memory and which components are not called into memory by default when a program is first launched. Dynamic function loading is a method of speeding up the initial load time of a program. Because expansive applications often contain many features that may never be used, this method of loading instructs the system loader to load only the dependent components of a program that are specifically requested. In this way the performance of a program can be improved.

dynamic_HTML
(1) Refers to Web content that changes each time it is viewed. For example, the same URL could result in a different page depending on any number of parameters, such as:  Geographic location of the reader Time of day Previous pages viewed by the reader Profile of the reader   There are many technologies for producing dynamic HTML, including CGI scripts, Server-Side Includes (SSI), cookies, Java, JavaScript, and ActiveX.  (2) When capitalized, Dynamic HTML refers to new HTML extensions that will enable a Web page to react to user input without sending requests to the Web server. Microsoft and Netscape have submitted competing Dynamic HTML proposals to W3C, which is producing the final specification.  

dynamic_NAT
(dī-nam´ik nat) (n.) A type of NAT in which a private IP address is mapped to a public IP address drawing from a pool of registered (public) IP addresses. Typically, the NAT router in a network will keep a table of registered IP addresses, and when a private IP address requests access to the Internet, the router chooses an IP address from the table that is not at the time being used by another private IP address. Dynamic NAT helps to secure a network as it masks the internal configuration of a private network and makes it difficult for someone outside the network to monitor individual usage patterns. Another advantage of dynamic NAT is that it allows a private network to use private IP addresses that are invalid on the Internet but useful as internal addresses.  Compare with static NAT.

dynamic_RAM
A type of physical memory used in most personal computers. The term dynamic indicates that the memory must be constantly refreshed (reenergized) or it will lose its contents. RAM  (random-access memory) is sometimes referred to as DRAM (pronounced dee-ram) to distinguish it from static RAM (SRAM). Static RAM is faster and less volatile than dynamic RAM, but it requires more power and is more expensive.


dynamic_shared_object
A dynamic shared object (DSO) is an object file that is intended to be used simultaneously (or shared by) multiple applications while they're  executing. A DSO can be used in place of archive  libraries and will minimize overall memory usage because code is shared. Two executables that use the same DSO and that run simultaneously have only one copy of the shared components loaded into memory. [Adapted from SGI]
