C
A high-level programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the mid 1970s. Although originally designed as a systems programming language, C has proved to be a powerful and flexible language that can be used for a variety of applications, from business programs to engineering. C is a particularly popular language for personal computer programmers because it is relatively small -- it requires less memory than other languages.
The first major program written in C was the UNIX operating system, and for many years C was considered to be inextricably linked with UNIX. Now, however, C is an important language independent of UNIX.
Although it is a high-level language, C is much closer to assembly language than are most other high-level languages. This closeness to the underlying machine language allows C programmers to write very efficient code. The low-level nature of C, however, can make the language difficult to use for some types of applications.

C_sharp
Pronounced "see-sharp." A hybrid of C and C++, it is a Microsoft programming language developed to compete with Sun's Java language. C# is an object-oriented programming language used with XML-based Web services on the .NET platform and designed for improving productivity in the development of Web applications. C# boasts type-safety, garbage collection, simplified type declarations, versioning and scalability support, and other features that make developing solutions faster and easier, especially for COM+ and Web services. Microsoft critics have pointed to the similarities between C# and Java. 

C_plus_plus
A high-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs. C++ adds object-oriented features to its predecessor, C. C++ is one of the most popular programming language for graphical applications, such as those that run in Windows and Macintosh environments.


c_software_engineer
A C++ Software Engineer is responsible for developing and/or implementing the new features to improve the existing programs and software. C++ is a general purpose language in computer programming. It is a middle level language that can be used for several purposes in the computer industry. C++ language may not always be the most preferred programming language, but there are many aspects of software programming that cannot be done with out the use of C++. When developing or improving computer systems engineers implement techniques of computer science, engineering, and mathematical analysis to produce the most optimal solution or innovation.

c_learning
Short for conventional learning, it refers to conventional teaching and learning within a brick-and-mortar classroom facility. Contrast with e-learning. See also "Computer Certifications" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

C_RIMM
Short for Continuity-RIMM. Since there cannot be any unused RIMM slots on a motherboard, a C-RIMM is a special module used to fill any unused RIMM slots. It is basically a RIMM module without any memory chips.

C60
Short for Carbon-60, a naturally occurring molecule comprised of 60 carbon atoms. Because C60 molecules are naturally spherical, they tend to cluster together. They are ideal for use as building blocks in nanoscale fabrication because the open structure lends itself to the formation of new compounds.

cable_headend
A cable television company's local facility that originates and communicates cable modem and cable TV services to its subscribers. The cable company's head-end includes the CMTS, which is essential in providing high-speed Internet access to cable subscribers.

cable_modem
A modem designed to operate over cable TV lines. Because the coaxial cable used by cable TV provides much greater bandwidth than telephone lines, a cable modem can be used to achieve extremely fast access to the World Wide Web. This, combined with the fact that millions of homes are already wired for cable TV, has made the cable modem something of a holy grail for Internetand cable TV companies.
There are a number of technical difficulties, however. One is that the cable TV infrastructure is designed to broadcast TV signals in just one direction - from the cable TV company to people's homes. The Internet, however, is a two-way system where data also needs to flow from the client to the server. In addition, it is still unknown whether the cable TV networks can handle the trafficthat would ensue if millions of users began using the system for Internet access.
Despite these problems, cable modems that offer speeds up to 2 Mbpsare already available in many areas.

cache
Pronounced cash, a special high-speed storage mechanism. Cache can be either a reserved section of main memory or an independent high-speed storage device. Two types of caching are commonly used in personal computers: memory caching and disk caching.
Memory Caching
A memory cache, sometimes called a cache store or RAM cache, is a portion of memory made of high-speed static RAM (SRAM) instead of the slower and cheaper dynamic RAM (DRAM) used for main memory. Memory caching is effective because most programs access the same data or instructions over and over. By keeping as much of this information as possible in SRAM, the computer avoids accessing the slower DRAM.


cache_coherence
(cash cōhēr´&ns) (n.) A protocol for managing the caches of a multiprocessor system so that no data is lost or overwritten before the data is transferred from a cache to the target memory. When two or more computer processors work together on a single program, known as multiprocessing, each processor may have its own memory cache that is separate from the larger RAM that the individual processors will access. A memory cache, sometimes called a cache store or RAM cache, is a portion of memory made of high-speed static RAM (SRAM) instead of the slower and cheaper dynamic RAM (DRAM) used for main memory. Memory caching is effective because most programs access the same data or instructions over and over. By keeping as much of this information as possible in SRAM, the computer avoids accessing the slower DRAM.   When multiple processors with separate caches share a common memory, it is necessary to keep the caches in a state of coherence by ensuring that any shared operand that is changed in any cache is changed throughout the entire system. This is done in either of two ways: through a directory-based or a snooping system. In a directory-based system, the data being shared is placed in a common directory that maintains the coherence between caches. The directory acts as a filter through which the processor must ask permission to load an entry from the primary memory to its cache. When an entry is changed the directory either updates or invalidates the other caches with that entry. In a snooping system, all caches on the bus monitor (or snoop) the bus to determine if they have a copy of the block of data that is requested on the bus. Every cache has a copy of the sharing status of every block of physical memory it has.   Cache misses and memory traffic due to shared data blocks limit the performance of parallel computing in multiprocessor computers or systems. Cache coherence aims to solve the problems associated with sharing data. 

Cache_Logical_Partition
A Cache Logical Partition (CLPR) defines the assignment of a specific data cache allocation and the assignment of one or more parity groups assigned to that cache allocation. [Source: Sun StorEdge White Paper]

CAD
)Acronym for computer-aided design. A CAD system is a combination of hardware and software that enables engineers and architects to design everything from furniture to airplanes. In addition to the software, CAD systems require a high-quality graphics monitor; a mouse, light pen, or digitizing tablet for drawing; and a special printer or plotterfor printing design specifications.
CAD systems allow an engineer to view a design from any angle with the push of a button and to zoom in or out for close-ups and long-distance views. In addition, the computer keeps track of design dependencies so that when the engineer changes one value, all other values that depend on it are automatically changed accordingly.
Until the mid 1980s, all CAD systems were specially constructed computers. Now, you can buy CAD software that runs on general-purpose workstations and personal computers.

CAD_CAM
Acronym for computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing, computer systems used to design and manufacture products. The term CAD/CAM implies that an engineer can use the system both for designing a product and for controlling manufacturing processes. For example, once a design has been produced with the CADcomponent, the design itself can control the machines that construct the part.


CADD
Acronym for computer-aided design and drafting. CADD systems are CAD systems with additional drafting features. For example, CADD systems enable an engineer or architect to insert size annotations and other notes into a design.

caddy

cadillac_cue
An information and entertainment "in-vehicle infotainment" system that's offered with select Cadillac vehicles such as the 2013 Cadillac XTS and ATS sedans as well as the SRX crossover.  CUE stands for the Cadillac User Experience and is designed to provide Cadillac drivers with a complete suite of infotainment, navigation and communication tools for keeping the driver connected.
The CUE system offers natural voice recognition as well as several unique features, including proximity sensing and tactile feedback via a haptic touchscreen, and delivers its information content in an 8-inch touch screen above the instrument panel as well as a 12.3-inch LCD gauge cluster above the steering wheel that features up to four different layouts.  Additional features include integration with mobile smartphones via Bluetooth technology, the ability to have text messages read to the driver, 3D GPS navigation and seamless connectivity with OnStar’s suite of services.
CUE competes in the nascent in-vehicle infotainment category with the likes of Ford’s SYNC, Toyota's Entune, Kia Motors' UVO and Fiat’s Blue&Me offerings.  While many of these systems are powered by Intel’s Atom processor and Microsoft’s Windows Embedded Automotive 7 platform, Cadillac has taken a different approach with its Linux-based CUE system.

CAE
Abbreviation of computer-aided engineering, computer systems that analyze engineering designs. Most CAD systems have a CAE component, but there are also independent CAE systems that can analyze designs produced by various CAD systems. CAE systems are able to simulate a design under a variety of conditions to see if it actually works.  

CAIFI
Short for customer average interruption frequency index, in smart grid technology it is a measure of electricity reliability.

Cakewalk_Application_Language
Short for Cakewalk Application Language. CAL is an event-processing language that you use to extend Pro Audio and Professional with custom editing commands. You can write your own CAL program and use or edit CAL programs that other people have written. You also can create CAL programs by recording a series of commands, keystrokes, and mouse actions. Pro Audio and Professional translate and save these actions as CAL programs, which you can use or edit.

CAL
Short for client access license, CAL is a license that gives a user the right to access the services of the server. CALs are primarily used for Microsoft Server products where the CAL is based on a per seat licensing (also called per user or per device), per server licensing, per processor licensing, or per mailbox licensing.

calculated_column

calculator
(1) A small hand-held computer that performs mathematical calculations. Some calculators even permit simple text editing and programming.  (2) A program on a computer that simulates a hand-held calculator. Calculator programs let you perform simple math calculations without leaving the computer. The Apple Macintosh comes with a calculator desk accessory. Likewise, Microsoft Windows includes a calculator accessory.   

calendar
A program that enables you to record events and appointments on an electronic calendar. Computer calendars act like datebooks, but they have several advantages over traditional datebooks:  automatic entries for regular events: You can specify, for example, that the first Thursday of every month is bridge night, and the calendar program will automatically fill in the appropriate days. signaling of upcoming events: Most calendars will let you know that an event is approaching by issuing beeps. clean deletion: With an electronic calendar, you can erase an appointment without leaving a trace.   Calendar software is part of a more general category of software known as PIMs (personal information managers). A special type of calendar, called a scheduler, enables groups of users connected to a network to coordinate their schedules.   

calibrate
On an iPod or iPhone calibrate is the term used to describe the act of running the battery all the way down (full discharge) and then charging it all the way up to full again.   See also "iPhone and iPhone 3G b . What's The Difference?" in Webopedia's Did You Know...? section.

caliper
A term commonly associated with printing which is used to measure paper thickness in thousandths of an inch.

call
(v.) To invoke a routine in a programming language. Calling a routine consists of specifying the routine name and, optionally, parameters. For example, the following is a function  call in the C programming language:  printf("Hello")  The name of the function is printf and the parameter is "Hello." This function call causes the computer to display the word Hello on the display screen.  A routine that invokes another routine is sometimes referred to as the calling routine . The routine that is invoked is referred to as the called routine.  (n.) (1) An invocation of a routine.  (2) The formation of a voice or data transmission connection between two endpoints.

call_agent
See media gateway controller.

call_center
A call center is a centralized office -- or facility -- that is equipped to handle large amounts of customer telephone requests for an organization. A call center handles all telephone communications with new and existing customers.  A call center facility provides ample workspace for a large number of employees, typically referred to as "call agents," to administer telephone-based communications with customers.  
Call centers may also use a call center suite which includes tools for telephone switch functionality, intelligent routing, automatic call distribution, interactive voice response (IVR), outbound dialing, voice mail and other components.
Large organizations may choose to outsource its call center services, as a call center will be able to provide the systems and trained workforce to provide quality service to customers.

call-center-crm-software
Call center CRM software, also called call center CRM (customer relationship management), are software solutions that help call center agents access the right information and knowledge about a customer's history to improve the overall customer experience. Call center CRM is typically desktop software that integrate with existing telephony and back-office applications.
Recommended Reading: What does customer experience mean?
The Benefits of Call Center CRM
One major benefit to using call center CRM software is that it enables call center agents to access information and knowledge in real-time to deliver the correct information to customers during telephone and online support calls.

call_center_outsourcing
A phrase used to describe the practice of seeking resources -- or subcontracting -- outside of an organizational structure for all or part of a call center function. An organization might outsource its call center because it is cheaper to contract a third-party than it would be to build its own in-house call center facility and management team.
See call center. See also outsource.

call_center_suite
A suite of software products that include multiple integrated components commonly used in a call center. The suite provides organizations with virtually everything needed to perform all call center operations within a single platform. Typically, a call center suite would include tools for telephone switch functionality, intelligent routing, automatic call distribution, interactive voice response (IVR), outbound dialing, voice mail and other components.

call_controller
See media gateway controller.

call_detail_record
(n.) Abbreviated as CDR. In Internet telephony, a call detail record is a data record that contains information related to a telephone call, such as the origination and destination addresses of the call, the time the call started and ended, the duration of the call, the time of day the call was made and any toll charges that were added through the network or charges for operator services, among other details of the call.

call_divert
In mobile phone technology, call divert is a phone feature that enables the user to forward or redirect their incoming calls to an alternate number, which can be a landline or cellular number. Users can also choose to divert incoming calls directly to voicemail. When call divert is enabled, the phone does noit ring at the original number of the incoming call, but rather only at the locations the call had been diverted to.

call_signaling
Call signaling is a process that is used to set up a connection in a telephone network. In VoIP systems, call signaling establishes connections between H.323 or SIP endpoints (or between an endpoint and a gatekeeper).

calling_card
A telecommunication credit card used by consumers to pay for telephone and cellular services.  Calling cards employ a prepaid credit system through the use of prepaid calling cards. If a card allows consumers to add funds to the card, it is a refillable card and will usually have permanent PIN. Other types of calling cards have a defined number of calling minutes available. Users enter the calling card code into their cellphone to activate the time and dispose of the card. Calling cards are a common way for consumers to pre-pay for long distance telephone services, and are also commonly used for Pay-As-You-Go cellular phone plans.

CAM
(1) Short for channel access method, a protocol for how data is transmitted in the bottom two layers of the OSI model. CAMs describe how networking systems put data on the network media, how low-level errors are dealt with, and how the network polices itself. Polling, contention and token passingare three examples of CAMs.
 (2) Acronym for computer-aided manufacturing, a type of computer application that helps automate a factory. For example, the following are types of CAM systems

real-timecontrol
robotics
materials requirements

All these systems are concerned with automatically directing the manufacture and inventory of parts.

camcorder
An electronic device that contains both a video camera and recording device. They are generally a small portable device that can record live video and usually audio as well. Camcorders support playback of the captured video through consumer electronics such as a VCR, TV or computer.Contrast with digital camera which records still images.

camera_ready
In desktop publishing, camera-ready refers to the final state of a publication before it is printed. Historically, the term has meant that the copy is ready to be photographed and turned into plates for offset printing. Increasingly, however, it is possible to print directly from the electronic version, either by sending it to a high-resolution laser printer or to a special device that can generate plates directly from electronic elements rather than from photographs. In these cases, therefore, camera-ready means merely that the document is ready to be printed.  

cloud_application_management_platforms_camp
CAMP, short for Cloud Application Management for Platforms, is a specification designed to ease management of applications -- including packaging and deployment -- across public and private cloud computing platforms.
According to the technology vendors behind the CAMP specification, which includes CloudBees, Cloudsoft Corporation, Huawei, Oracle, Rackspace, Red Hat and Software AG, CAMP is intended to provide a common basis for developing multi-cloud management tools as well as a REST-based approach to application management.
The CAMP specification provides a common development API that can work across multiple clouds without excessive adaptation and is compatible with PaaS-aware (Platform as a Service) and PaaS-unaware application development environments, both offline and in the cloud.

CAN
(1) Acronym for campus-area network. An interconnection of local-area networks within a limited geographical space, such as a school campus or a military base.  (2) See controller area network.

CAN_SPAM
The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (acronym for Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing Act of 2003) officially came into law on January 1, 2004. The CAN-SPAM Act applies to almost all businesses in the US that use e-mail, and provides recipients of  spam with the right to opt-out of these spam messages, and have their opt-out (or unsubscribe) request acted upon.  Under the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, permission of the e-mail recipient is not required prior to sending out the e-mails, however if a recipient wants to unsubscribe or opt-out of the mailings then the business must stop sending the e-mails as per the opt-out request or face severe penalties. In addition to enforcing an opt-out or unsubscribe system for recipients, the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 also prohibits some of the common spammer trickery such as; changing mail servers to send the spam, changing e-mail headers or the "from" e-mail address to hide the identity of the sender, and using deceptive subject heading. Damages for non-compliance can result in the spammer facing fines of up to $250 per illegal e-mail message up to a maximum of $2 million or more if the offense includes certain aggravating violations. In situations involving e-mail deception, the penalty could be jail time.

candela
Abbreviated cd, the International System of Units standard unit of measurement of luminous intensity. The candela is equal to the luminous intensity in a given direction of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 x 1012 hertz and has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per unit solid angle  The measurement of luminous intensity is often expressed as the ratio of candelas per square meter (cd/m2), representing a luminous intensity of candelas radiating from a surface whose area is one square meter.  The luminous intensity of computer monitors, such as CRT monitors, is often expressed in candelas.

candy_bar
A candy bar or candy bar mobile is a mobile phone form factor where the phone is a solid device with no moving parts except for the keypad buttons, and in some cases, the antenna.
Because the candy bar style does not have anything covering the buttons these types of phones offer a key guard that prevent keys from being pushed when the phone is not in use. Several mobile phones using the candy bar form factor include the Apple iPhone, RIM Blackberry the Sony Ericsson, and the Motorola (Sprint) MOTO Q.

Canon_Inc
Founded in 1937, Canon Inc. produces and markets products and solutions for homes, offices and industries worldwide including products such as copying machines, laser beam printers, inkjet printers, multifunctio printers, fax machines,  digital cameras, digital video cameras, and more.

canonical
(adj.) Authoritative or standard; conforming to an accepted rule or procedure.  When referring to programming, canonical means conforming to well-established patterns or rules. The term is typically used to describe whether or not a programming interface follows the already established standard.  When referring to IP addressing, canonical means the authoritative host name stored in a DNS database that all of an IP address�� aliases resolve to. Also see CNAME.

canvio_connect

Canvio Connect is  a portable USB 3.0 hard drive that enables personal cloud storage. The Canvio Connect comes preinstalled with software that turns the portable drive into an online file server when it is plugged into a Windows or Mac computer.  As long as the Canvio Connect is connected to an Internet-enabled PC that is powered on, users will have complete access to files, photos, music and movies from any device.

CAPs bring together multiple functions such as voice switching, enterprise routing, firewall and VPN, quality of service, application services, WAN and Wi-Fi access.
 
See also platform.

capacitance_scanner
A type of fingerprint scanner that requires a real fingerprint as opposed to a black and white image that would be used on an optical scanner. This type of scanner senses the fingerprint using electrical current instead of light, as optical scanners do and are said to me more secure as it is more difficult to forge a fingerprint on a capacitive scanner.
 
See  "How Fingerprint Scanners Work" in the ""Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. See also  "How Biometrics Security Works" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia.

capacitive_keyboard
A type of keyboard design that uses changes in capacitance, or stored static electricity, rather than changes in flows of electricity used by contact keyboards to register when a user has depressed a specific key on the keyboard. Under the keyboard��s keys are capacitors that store electricity as opposite static charges in pairs of conductive plates made from nickel-plated copper that are separated by a non-conductive material (typically some form of plastic). The opposite static charges hold an attractive field between them, but the insulating material prevents the charges from canceling each other out by coming together. When a key is pressed, the pads move closer to each other and change the capacity for storing a charge, which the keyboard detects as a start or stop in the flow of electricity and inputs the correct keystroke.  Capacitive keyboards are more durable than contact keyboards and are resistant to oxidization, which can weaken a keyboard��s mechanics.

capacitive_touch
One of the two primary types of touchscreen displays (along with resistive) employed on smartphones, tablets, laptops and similar electronic devices. The Apple iPhone is the most popular example of a capacitive touchscreen-based device.  Capacitive touch screens distinguish and sense specific touch location based on the electrical impulses in a human body, typically the fingertip. This enables capacitive touchscreens to not require any actual force to be applied to the screen’s surface; at the same time, capacitive screens typically don't respond to styluses or gloved hands due to the lack of electrical impulses generated.


capacitor
A passive electronic component that holds a charge in the form of an electrostatic field. They are often used in combination with transistors in DRAM, acting as storage cells to hold bits.  Capacitors typically consist of conducting plates separated by thin layers of dielectric material, such as dry air or mica. The plates on opposite sides of the dielectric material are oppositely charged and the electrical energy of the charged system is stored in the polarized dielectric.

capacity_requirements_planning_crp
Abbreviated as CRP, capacity requirements planning, is an enterprise application that is used by an organization, usually in manufacturing, when developing a product plan to estimate capacity requirements.
The enterprise software can help an organization determine what is needed to meet the production plan, including labor, materials, systems -- basically any resource required for production fulfillment. CRP can estimate, based on data input, what additional resources would be required to meet the production plan.

CapEx
An acronym for Capital Expenses, CapEx refers to business costs associated with acquiring, developing or upgrading physical assets such as hardware systems or intangible assets like patents and other intellectual property.
Capital expenditures stand in contrast to operating expenditures, or OpEx, which are the ongoing costs associated with the daily operations of business products, services and/or systems.
CapEx from an Accounting Perspective
From an accounting perspective, CapEx or capital expenditures refer to business costs allocated to creating future benefits, such as acquiring new fixed assets or upgrading existing ones.

CAPI
(1) Short for computer assisted personal interviewing, a surveying technique that uses a computer-based questionnaire. As an alternative to paper questionnaires, CAPI allows the interviewer to customize the survey, so that respondents answer questions only about subjects they're familiar with and receive questions in a random order to avoid biases. CAPI also seeks to improve accessibility to data and to make the interviewing process more entertaining. Although traditionally used on individual PCs, CAPI is now also being administered on the Web.  (2) Short for common ISDN application programming interface, an API standard used to access ISDN equipment (equipment that use the integrated services digital network [ISDN] standard for the transfer of data over telephone lines). When an application wants to communicate with an ISDN card it sends a standard series of commands to the card. These commands form the CAPI standard and give developers and users a chance to use a well-defined mechanism for communications over ISDN lines without being forced to adjust to hardware idiosyncrasies.   

caps
Short for capital letters. For example, "all caps" means all letters capitalized.  

Caps_Lock_key
A toggle  key on computer keyboards that, when activated, causes all subsequent alphabetic characters to be uppercase, but has no effect on other keys.   

CAPTCHA
Short for completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart, a technique used by a computer to tell if it is interacting with a human or another computer. Because computing is becoming pervasive, and computerized tasks and services are commonplace, the need for increased levels of security has led to the development of this way for computers to ensure that they are dealing with humans in situations where human interaction is essential to security. Activities such as online commerce transactions, search engine submissions, Web polls, Web registrations, free e-mail service registration and other automated services are subject to software programs, or bots, that mimic the behavior of humans in order to skew the results of the automated task or perform malicious activities, such as gathering e-mail addresses for spamming or ordering hundreds of tickets to a concert.  In order to validate the digital transaction, using the CAPTCHA system the user is presented with a distorted word typically placed on top of a distorted background. The user must type the word into a field in order to complete the process. Computers have a difficult time decoding the distorted words while humans can easily decipher the text. Some CAPTCHAs now use pictures instead of words where the user is presented with a series of pictures and asked what is the common element among all of the pictures. By entering that common element, the user validates the transaction and the computer knows it is dealing with a human and not a bot.  The word public in the term refers to the fact that the algorithm used is made public instead of being held secret. The idea is that breaking the scurity of a CAPTCHA depends on artifical intelligence; discovering the algorithm itself does not defeat the security measures. The term was coined by Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum and Nicholas J. Hopper of Carnegie Mellon University, and John Langford of IBM in 2000.

caption
In video terminology a caption is used to mean a text representation of the audio in the video. Captions are often used by those viewers who are hearing impaired, and will describe what is being said, emotions, and background sounds. Captions can also used for indexing and retrieval.

captive_portal
A Web page used on public-access networks that require a user to view and interact with before being granted access to the public network. Captive portals are widely used by businesses that offer free Wi-Fi hotspots to Internet users. Usually a captive portal requires users to read and accept the business' acceptable use policy (AUP).
See "Public Wi-Fi Hotspots" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

capture
(1) (v.) To save a particular state of a program. The term capture often refers to saving the information currently displayed on a display screen. You can capture the screen to a printer or to a file. The act of saving a display screen is called a screen capture.  (2)(n.) Video capture refers to storing video images in a computer.  (3)(n.) The recording of keystrokes during the definition of a macro.  (4) (n.) In a biometric security system, the process of acquiring a biometric sample from a user.

capture_card

carbon_footprint
The amount of carbon dioxide emissions created by a person or industry. A 2007 study by Gartner indicated that two percent of worldwide carbon emissions comes from the global information and communications technology (ICT) industry.

Carbon_Free_Computing
VIA Carbon Free Computing is an initiative launched by VIA Technologies, a manufacturer of microprocessors and chipsets in October 2006. Carbon Free Computing is a set of programs and products designed to help individuals and organizations reduce their impact on the environment. The VIA Carbon Free Computing is a part of the VIA Green Computing Initiative. Under the initiative VIA offers a line of PC products certified as Carbon Free. According to the company, VIA works with environmental experts to calculate the electricity used by an average Carbon Free Computing product over its lifetime, assumed to be 3 years. Then from the amount of electricity used, VIA calculates how much carbon dioxide emissions will be released into the environment mainly as a result of fossil fuel burning power plants, and then works with regional offset organizations to "offset" that amount of carbon dioxide through projects such as reforestation, investments in alternative energy, and Energy conservation. (Adapted from VIA Carbon Free Computing) See carbon footprint. See also "Getting Started With Green Computing" in Webopedia's Did You Know...? section.

Carbon_Nanotube_Technology
Carbon nanotubes, or CNTs, are tubes of carbon atoms less than a nanometer (one billionth of a meter) in diameter. CNTs possess a combination of unique properties that make them highly programmable for a variety of purposes, including flat panel displays. In May 2005 Motorola Labs unveiled the first working 5-inch color video display prototype based on their proprietary carbon nanotube technology. See also nanotube.

carbon_neutral
Carbon neutral, also called carbon neutrality is a term used to describe the action of organizations, businesses and individuals taking action to remove as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as each put in to it. The overall goal of carbon neutrality is to achieve a zero carbon footprint. For example, a business may plant trees in different places around the world to offset the electricity the business uses. This practice is often called carbon offset or offsetting. See carbon footprint. See also "Getting Started With Green Computing" in Webopedia's Did You Know...? section.

card
(1) Same as expansion board.  (2) In hypertext systems such as HyperCard, a card is a single page of information.  

card_skimming
(card skim'ming) (n.) The act of using a skimmer to illegally collect data from the magnetic stripe of a credit, debit or ATM card. This information, copied onto another blank card's magnetic stripe, is then used by an identity thief to make purchases or withdraw cash in the name of the actual account holder.
Skimming works by replacing a card reader like an ATM with a camouflaged counterfeit card reader. The counterfeit reader records all of the data on a credit, debit or ATM card as it passes through the skimmer. In addition to ATMs, other locations where card skimming happens include restaurants, taxis or other businesses where an employee will take the card from the actual account holder in order to run the charge. In these instances, the thief has fitted the card reader with a skimmer, or uses a hand-held skimmer hidden in a pocket.
Also see "How to Protect Against Card Skimming" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia.

CardBus
The 32-bit version of the PCMCIA PC Card standard. In addition to supporting a wider bus (32 bits instead of 16 bits), CardBus also supports bus mastering and operation speeds up to 33 MHz.  

caret
A wedge-shaped symbol (^) generally found above the 6 on computer keyboards. In older technical documentation, the caret is often used to indicate the Control key. For example, "^C" would mean press the "C" key while holding down the Control key. Most modern documentation, however, would specify this key sequence as Ctrl +C.  The caret symbol is also called a hat.  

careware
A type of software licensing where the software author asks the users to pay for the software but not with money. Instead the request may be for a postcard, an e-mail letter, or other token of appreciation that is not monetary based.

Carnivore
A network software diagnostic tools created and used by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in crime investigation. Carnivore is a Windows-based with packet-sniffing software that is installed at an Internet service provider (ISP) to sniff traffic on a LAN, looking for e-mail messages in transit. The FBI may only use the Carnivore system in places where permission by the system or ISP owner has been granted, or with a a court order as part of an investigation. The FBI has retired Carnivore and now uses commercial products instead.

CARP
Acronym for Common Address Redundancy Protocol. CARP is a free alternative to the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) and the Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP). Its primary purpose is to allow multiple hosts on the same network segment to share an IP address. CARP works by allowing a group of hosts on the same network segment to share an IP address. This group of hosts is referred to as a redundancy group. The redundancy group is assigned an IP address that is shared among the group members. Within the group, one host is designated the master and the rest as back-ups. The master host is the one that currently holds the shared IP. It responds to any traffic or ARP requests directed towards it. Each host may belong to more than one redundancy group at a time. [Adapted from OpenBSD.org]

carpal_tunnel_syndrome
A common form of Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) produced by repeating the same small movements many times. As more and more people use computers, carpal tunnel syndrome and other forms of RSI have become more prevalent. Typical symptoms are numbness or burning in the fingers or wrist. If not addressed early on, the injury can cause permanent damage.  There are a number of ways to avoid carpal tunnel syndrome, including adjusting the height and angle of your chair and keyboard, and taking frequent breaks from typing. Modern office furniture, designed especially for computer use, can help considerably.  

carputer
Carputer refers to any computing platform that is installed in a vehicle. While some aftermarket carputers are available to consumers, most carputers are built by enthusiasts using desktop PC components from smaller form factors like the mini-ITX  or microATX. Carputers are mainly used for playing music and DVD movies, connecting to the Internet, and navigation. Carputer may also be called Car PC. Also see From  AT to BTX: Motherboard Form Factors in Webopedia's "Did You Know...?" section. 

carriage
The mechanism on a printer that feeds paper. A wide-carriage printer  is a printer that can accept very wide paper. A narrow-carriage printer is a printer that accepts only standard-sized paper.   

carriage_return
Often abbreviated CR, a carriage return is a special code that moves the cursor (or print head) to the beginning of the current  line. In the ASCII character set, a carriage return has a decimal value of 13.  

carrier
Short for carrier signal, carrier system, or carrier service provider:  carrier signal: A frequency in a communications channel modulated to carry analog or digital signal information. For example, an FM radio transmitter modulates the frequency of a carrier signal and the receiver processes the carrier signal to extract the analog information. An AM radio transmitter modulates the amplitude of a carrier signal. carrier system: A communications system providing a number of point-to-point channels through some type of multiplexing. T-1 and T-3 carrier services are examples of carrier systems that can be used between points in a Wide Area Network (WAN). carrier service provider: A company offering telephone and data communications between points in a state or in one or more countries. The Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) are example of carriers.   

Carrier_Ethernet
Carrier Ethernet is high speed Ethernet for Metro Area Networks. It defines native  Ethernet packet access to the  Internet as well as increasing penetration of  wireless  networks, which present a direct challenge to the traditional  SONET telephony infrastructure, and promises Wide Area networking scalable beyond 10Gbps using ubiquitous Ethernet technology. The Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF), a standards organization, has made a commitment to the new standard with their simultaneous launch of a Carrier Ethernet Certification Program to accelerate the delivery of industry standard products and services to the end user.

carriers_carrier
A carrier's carrier is a telecommunications industry business model where a carrier sells or leases bandwidth on its own infrastructure to another telecom carrier for reselling to their own customers. There are two applications for carrier's carrier; the customer carrier is an Internet service provider (ISP), or the customer carrier is an MPLS VPN provider. Also called  carrier-of-carriers.

cartooney
A slang term used to mean "cartoon attorney." The word is used to describe a type of email spam message -- or unsolicited email -- that is written in such a way that a spammer wants the recipient to believe lawyers and legal threats that they mention in the e-mail are legitimate. These types of messages are frequently sent by a spammer when they realize they have been blocked by spam filters, usually at the ISP-level, and cannot send mass spam messages. May also be seen written as "cart00ney."

cartridge
(1) A removable storage medium (tape, disk, or memory chip). Some printers have slots in which you can insert cartridges to load different fonts. A font loaded from a cartridge is called a font cartridge or cartridge font.  The term removable cartridge usually refers to a type of hard disk that you can remove. Removable cartridges offer the speed of hard disks along with the portability of floppy disks.  (2) For laser and ink-jet printers, a toner  cartridge is a metal container that holds the toner. 

cartridge_refill_kit
In inkjet printing, a refill kit is a do-it-yourself option for refilling an empty printer ink cartridge. The kit will include compatible ink for your printer that matches your cartridge type, as well as an injector needle which you use to fill the empty ink cartridge.

CAS
Abbreviated as CAS, a signal, or strobe, sent by the processor to a DRAM circuit to activate a column address. DRAM stores data in a series of rows and columns, similar in theory to a spreadsheet, and each cell where a data bit is stored exists in both a row and a column. A processor uses CAS and RAS (row address strobe) signals to retrieve data from DRAM. When data is needed, the processor activates the RAS line to specify the row where the data is needed, and then activates the CAS line to specify the column. Combined, the two signals locate the data stored in DRAM.

cascading
In videoconferencing systems, cascading is the term used to describe the method for allowing multiple participants to enter the conference beyond what a single multipoint control unit (MCU) can support. Cascading usually means to connect two separate MCUs, where the second MCU acts and is treated as other participants. The host MCU will send the joining MCU the processed data streams which are then distributed to its the videoconference participants.

cascading_windows
An arrangement of windows such that they overlap one another. Typically, the title bar remains visible so that you can always see which windows are open. Cascading windows are also called overlaid windows. An alternative arrangement of windows, in which every window is completely visible, is called tiled windows.   

CASE
Short for Computer Aided Software Engineering, a category of softwarethat provides a development environment for programming teams. CASE systems offer tools to automate, manage and simplify the development process. These can include tools for:

Summarizing initial requirements
Developing flow diagrams
Scheduling development tasks
Preparing documentation
Controlling software versions
Developing program code

Various companies offer CASE software capable of supporting some or all of these activities. While many CASE systems provide special support for object-oriented programming, the term CASE can apply to any type of software development environment.


case_sensitive
(adj.) Describes a program's ability to distinguish between uppercase (capital) and lowercase (small) letters.
A case-sensitive program that expects you to enter all commands in uppercase will not respond correctly if you enter one or more characters in lowercase. It will treat the command RUN differently from run. Programs that do not distinguish between uppercase and lowercase are said to be case-insensitive.


Castanet
Software from Marimba, Inc. of Mountain View, CA (www.marimba.com) that helps administrators install and update applications and information across a network. For example, if a number of users on a network use a version of Microsoft Word that's been recently updated, the administrator can use Castanet to update the users' versions without physically installing each new package. Castanet will examine the old and the new versions, identify differences (a process called differencing), and send the changes to each user. Castenet uses channels, usually containing one kind of application, to send information to users, who receive them with a desktop application called a tuner. Administrators control content at the back-end with a transmitter. 

casters_up_mode
Slang term used to describe software or applications that do not work correctly. For example, if you were using a program that froze, you would say the program is in "casters-up mode" or that it went "casters-up".

Cat_5
Short for Category 5, network cabling that consists of four twisted pairs of copper wire terminated by RJ45 connectors. Cat-5 cabling supports frequencies up to 100 MHz and speeds up to 1000 Mbps. It can be used for ATM, token ring, 1000Base-T, 100Base-T, and 10Base-Tnetworking.
Computers hooked up to LANs are connected using Cat-5 cables, so if you're on a LAN, most likely the cable running out of the back of your PC is Category 5.
Cat-5 is based on the EIA/TIA 568 Commercial Building Telecommunications Wiring Standard developed by the Electronics Industries Association as requested by the Computer Communications Industry Association in 1985.

Cat_5e
Short for Category 5 Enhanced, Cat-5e network cabling is used as a cabling infrastructure for 10BASE-T (Ethernet), full duplex 100BASE-TX (Fast Ethernet) and 1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet, or GbE) networks.  The Cat 5e standard provides performance of up to 100 MHz and can be used up to a maximum length of 100 meters.
As with Category 5 (Cat-5) cables, Cat 5e cables typically consist of four unshielded twisted pairs (UTP) of copper wire terminated by RJ45 connectors.   Cat 5e is distinguished from the original Cat 5 standard primarily in its performance requirements.  Cat 5e has stricter specifications in a number of areas, including Near-End Crosstalk (NEXT), Power Sum Equal-Level Far-End Crosstalk (PS-ELFEXT), attenuation and return loss.
The Cat 5e standard was first released in 1999 as part of the Telecommunications Industry Association’s TIA/EIA-568-5-A document specification.  The Cat 5e cable standard is backward compatible with the Cat 3 and Cat 5 cable standards.

cat_6
Short for Category 6, Cat-6 network cabling is used as the cabling infrastructure for 10BASE-T (Ethernet), 100BASE-TX (Fast Ethernet), 1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet, or GbE) and 10GBASE-T (10-Gigabit Ethernet, or 10 GbE) networks. The Cat 6 standard provides performance of up to 250 MHz (500 MHz for the newer Cat 6a standard) and can be used up to a maximum length of 100 meters (55 meters for 10GBASE-T networks).
The Cat 6 standard was first released in 2002 as part of the Telecommunications Industry Association’s TIA/EIA-568-B.2-1 document specification.  Cat 6 is backward compatible with the Cat 3, Cat 5 and Cat 5e cable standards, and as with Cat 5 and Cat 5e cabling, Cat 6 cables consist of four unshielded twisted pairs (UTP) of copper wire terminated by RJ45 connectors. 
In addition to its support for higher performance than the Cat 5 specification, the Cat 6 standard also includes more stringent specifications for crosstalk and system noise. While Cat 6 is expected to supersede both Cat 5 and Cat 5e cabling in the future, all three types of cables continue to be popular for use in network installations.

Cat_7
Short for Category 7, Cat-7 network cabling is used as a cabling infrastructure for 1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet, or GbE) and 10GBASE-T (10-Gigabit Ethernet, or 10 GbE) networks.  The Cat 7 standard provides performance of up to 600 MHz  (1000 MHz for the Cat-7a, or Augmented Category 7 standard) and can be used up to a maximum length of 100 meters.
Category 7 cable is able to achieve higher performance than preceding Ethernet standards such as Cat 5, Cat 5e and Cat 6 by requiring each of its twisted wire pairs to be fully shielded.  This is known as Screen Shielded Twisted Pair (SSTP) or Screened Foiled Twisted Pair (SFTP) wiring, and it almost completely eliminates alien crosstalk while significantly improving noise resistance.
The Cat 7 standard was published in 2002 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and is also known as Class F cabling.  While more expensive than Cat 5e and Cat 6 cabling, Cat-7 cabling does have a 15-year lifecycle (compared to estimated 10-year lifecycles for Cat 5e and Cat 6), which helps improve its overall return on investment (ROI). 

catch_all
A function of some e-mail servers that directs all questionable e-mail to a single mailbox.

catchlight
Slang term used to describe the appearance or reflection of light showing in a subject's eye in portrait photography. See also "The Digital Camera Picture" in Webopedia's Quick Reference section. 

CAV
Short for constant angular velocity, a technique for accessing data off of rotating disks. With CAV, the disk rotates at a constant speed regardless of what area of the disk is being accessed. This differs from Constant Linear Velocity (CLV), which rotates the disk faster for inner tracks. Disk drives use CAV, whereas CD-ROMs generally use CLV, though some newer drives use a combination of CAV and CLV.  The advantage of CAV is that it is much simpler to design and produce because the motor doesn't need to change speed. In addition, CLV runs into problems for very high-speed CD-ROMs because there's a brief latency whenever the drive needs to change the rotational speed. 

CAYOR
On eBay, eBay alternatives, and classified ad Web sites, CAYOR is an abbreviation used to mean cash at your own risk. This abbreviation is used by the seller to indicate that if the buyer chooses to pay cash for the item, and mail cash to the seller, the buyer is not responsible for missing or lost payments. See also "Online Auction Abbreviations" in the  Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

CBEFF
Short for Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework, it is a standard format for exchanging biometric data between different biometric devices and systems.

CBR
Short for constant bit rate, or Class A quality of service, an ATM bandwidth-allocation service that requires the user to determine a fixed bandwidth requirement at the time the connection is set up so that the data can be sent in a steady stream. CBR service is often used when transmitting fixed-rate uncompressed video.  Compare with ABR, UBR and VBR.

CBT
Acronym for computer-based training, a type of education in which the student learns by executing special training programs on a computer. CBT is especially effective for training people to use computer applications because the CBT program can be integrated with the applications so that students can practice using the application as they learn.
Historically, CBTs growth has been hampered by the enormous resources required: human resources to create a CBT program. and hardware resources needed to run it. However, the increase in PC computing power, and especially the growing prevalence of computers equipped with CD-ROMs, is making CBT a more viable option for corporations and individuals alike. Many PC applications now come with some modest form of CBT, often called a tutorial.
CBT is also called computer-assisted instruction (CAI).

CCD
Short for charge-coupled device, an instrument whose semiconductors are connected so that the output of one serves as the input of the next. Digital cameras, video cameras, and optical scanners all use CCD arrays.  Contrast with CIS. 

CCE
Abbreviated as CCE, Cinema Craft Encoder is an MPEG1/2 encoder manufactured by Custom Technology. Supported input files include AVI or QuickTime and DV files. Output is DVD or SCVD (MPEG2 compliant) or VCD (MPEG-1 compliant) streams.

CCITT
Abbreviation of Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique, an organization that sets international communications standards. CCITT, now known as ITU(the parent organization) has defined many important standards for data communications, including the following:

Group 3: The universal protocol for sending fax documents across telephone lines. The Group 3 protocol specifies CCITT T.4 data compression and a maximum transmission rate of 9,600 baud. There are two levels of resolution: 203 by 98 and 203 by 196.
Group 4 : A protocol for sending fax documents over ISDN networks. The Group 400 protocol supports images of up to 400 dpiresolution.
V.21: The standard for full-duplex communication at 300 baud in Japan and Europe. In the United States, Bell 103is used in place of V.21.
V.22 : The standard for half-duplex communication at 1,200 bps in Japan and Europe. In the United States, the protocol defined by Bell 212Ais more common.
V.22bis : The worldwide standard for full-duplex modems sending and receiving dataacross telephone lines at 1,200 or 2,400 bps.
V.29: The standard for half-duplex modems sending and receiving data across telephone lines at 1,200, 2,400, 4,800, or 9,600 bps. This is the protocol used by fax modems.
V.32 :The standard for full-duplex modems sending and receiving data across phone lines at 4,800 or 9,600 bps. V.32 modems automatically adjust their transmission speeds based on the quality of the lines.
V.32bis:The V.32 protocol extended to speeds of 7,200, 12,000, and 14,400 bps.
V.34 :The standard for full-duplex modems sending and receiving data across phone lines at up to 28,800 bps. V.34 modems automatically adjust their transmission speeds based on the quality of the lines.
V.42 : An error-detection standard for high-speed modems. V.42 can be used with digital telephone networks. See MNPfor a competing standard.
V.42bis:A data compression protocol that can enable modems to achieve a data transfer rate of 34,000 bps.
V.90: The standard for full-duplex modems sending and receiving data across phone lines at up to 56,600 bps.
X.25: The most popular packet-switchingprotocol for WANs.
X.400: The universal protocol for e-mail. X.400 defines the envelope for e-mail messages so all messages conform to a standard format.
X.500: An extension to X.400 that defines addressing formats so all e-mail systems can be linked together.


CCK
Short for Complementary Code Keying, a set of 64 eight-bit code words used to encode data for 5.5 and 11Mbps data rates in the 2.4GHz band of 802.11b wireless networking. The code words have unique mathematical properties that allow them to be correctly distinguished from one another by a receiver even in the presence of substantial noise and multipath interference.  CCK works only in conjunction with the DSSS technology that is specified in the original 802.11 standard. It does not work with FHSS. CCK applies sophisticated mathematical formulas to the DSSS codes, permitting the codes to represent a greater volume of information per clock cycle. The transmitter can then send multiple bits of information with each DSSS code, enough to make possible the 11Mbps of data rather than the 2Mbps in the original standard.

CCNA
Acronym for Cisco Certified Network Associate indicates a foundation in and apprentice knowledge of networking. CCNA certified professionals can install, configure, and operate LAN, WAN, and dial access services for small networks (100 nodes or fewer), including but not limited to use of these protocols: IP, IGRP, Serial, Frame Relay, IP RIP, VLANs, RIP, Ethernet, Access Lists. *

ccTLD
Short for country code Top-Level Domain, a typically two-letter domain name extension, such as .uk or .de, that corresponds to a country, territory or geographic location.  For a list of countries and their corresponding ccTLDs, see Countries and Their Domain Extensions in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

CCXML
Short for Call Control eXtensible Markup Language, CCXML is an XML-based language designed to provide telephony call control support for VoiceXML and other dialogue systems. CCXML can control the setup, monitoring and tear-down of phone calls. CCXML can provide a complete telephony service application, comprised of Web server CGI compliant application logic.

CD_plus_G
Short for Compact disc plus graphics. CD+G is an audio compact disc that contains graphics data in addition to audio data. These CDs can be played on a regular audio player but when played on a CD+G player, it outputs a graphics signal as well. This allows video pictures to be displayed as music is played. CD+G is a popular format for karaoke CDs.

CD_I_Compact_Disc_Interactive
A software and hardware standard developed jointly by Philips International and Sony Corporation for storing video, audio, and binary data on compact optical disks. It supports 552MB (megabytes) of binary data and specifies several different types of video and audio encoding formats. Unlike conventional CD-ROM drives, CD-I drives have a built-in microprocessor to handle many of the computing functions. It is sometimes referred to as the Green Book standard.  Although there are some CD-I devices and titles, the format has not become widely accepted. 

CD_Plus
A type of CD format that is enhanced to support multisessions. CD-Plus can store both video and audio data.

CD_R_drive
Short for Compact Disk-Recordable drive, a type of disk drive that can create CD-ROMs and audio CDs. This allows users to "master" a CD-ROM or audio CD for publishing. Until recently, CD-R drives were quite expensive, but prices have dropped dramatically.  A feature of many CD-R drives, called multisession recording, enables you to keep adding data to a CD-ROM over time. This is extremely important if you want to use the CD-R drive to create backup CD-ROMs.  To create CD-ROMs and audio CDs, you'll need not only a CD-R drive, but also a CD-R software package. Often, it is the software package, not the drive itself, that determines how easy or difficult it is to create CD-ROMs.  CD-R drives can also read CD-ROMs and play audio CDs.  

CD_ROM
Pronounced see-dee-rom. Short for Compact Disc-Read-Only Memory, a type of optical disk capable of storing large amounts of data -- up to 1GB, although the most common size is 650MB (megabytes). A single CD-ROM has the storage capacity of 700 floppy disks, enough memory to store about 300,000 textpages.
CD-ROMs are stamped by the vendor, and once stamped, they cannot be erased and filled with new data. To read a CD, you need a CD-ROM player. All CD-ROMs conform to a standard size and format, so you can load any type of CD-ROM into any CD-ROM player. In addition, CD-ROM players are capable of playing audio CDs, which share the same technology.
CD-ROMs are particularly well-suited to information that requires large storage capacity. This includes large software applications that support color, graphics, sound, and especially video.

CD_ROM_player
Also called a CD-ROM drive, a device that can read information from a CD-ROM. CD-ROM players can be either internal, in which case they fit in a bay, or external, in which case they generally connect to the computer's SCSI interface or parallel port. Parallel CD-ROM players are easier to install, but they have several disadvantages: They're somewhat more expensive than internal players, they use up the parallel port which means that you can't use that port for another device such as a printer, and the parallel port itself may not be fast enough to handle all the data pouring through it.  There are a number of features that distinguish CD-ROM players, the most important of which is probably their speed. CD-ROM players are generally classified as single-speed or some multiple of single-speed. For example, a 4X player access data at four times the speed of a single-speed player (also see Understanding CD Burner Speeds in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia). Within these groups, however, there is some variation. Also, you need to be aware of whether the CD-ROM uses the CLV or CAV technology. The reported speeds of players that use CAV are generally not accurate because they refer only to the access speed for outer tracks. Inner tracks are accessed more slowly.  Two more precise measurements are the drive's access time and data transfer rate. The access time measures how long, on average, it takes the drive to access a particular piece of information. The data transfer rate measures how much data can be read and sent to the computer in a second.  Finally, you should consider how the player connects to your computer. Many CD-ROMs connect via a SCSI bus. If your computer doesn't already contain such an interface, you will need to install one. Other CD-ROMs connect to an IDE or Enhanced IDE  interface, which is the one used by the hard disk drive; still others use a proprietary interface. 

CD_ROM_XA
Short for CD-ROM/eXtended Architecture, a specification developed by Sony, Phillips and Microsoft that enables many different types of data -- audio, video, compressed video, and graphics -- to be stored on a single CD-ROM.  

CD_RW
See CD-RW disk.

CD_RW_disk
Short for CD-ReWritable disk, a type of CD disk that enables you to write onto it in multiple sessions. One of the problems with CD-R disks is that you can only write to them once. With CD-RW drives and disks, you can treat the optical disk just like a floppy or hard disk, writing data onto it multiple times.
The first CD-RW drives became available in mid-1997. They can read CD-ROMs and can write onto today's CD-R disks, but they cannot write on normal CD-ROMs. This means that disks created with a CD-RW drive can only be read by a CD-RW drive. However, a new standard called MultiRead, developed jointly by Philips Electronics and Hewlett-Packard, will enable CD-ROM players to read disks create by CD-RW drives.
Many experts believe that CD-RW disks will be a popular storage medium until DVDdevices become widely available.

CDA
Short for Compact Disc Audio, CDA (.cda) are audio files that can be stored on CD media. The .cda files are representations of CD audio tracks. CDA (.cda) files can be played only from a CD-ROM. This is format used for encoding music on all commercial compact discs. [Adapted from CoolUtils.com]

CDDI
Abbreviation of Copper Data Distribution Interface, a network technology capable of carrying data at 100 Mbps over unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable. CDDI is a trade name of Crescendo Communications (acquired by Cisco Systems in 1993) and commonly used instead of the general term Twisted Pair Physical Layer Medium (TP-PMD). TP-PMD is the general ANSI standard name for this FDDI -like service.  CDDI cable lengths are limited to 100 meters.  

cdev
Short for control panel device, and pronounced see-dev, a cdev is a special type of Macintosh utility that enables you to adjust basic system parameters. On newer Macs (System 7 and later) cdevs are called control panels.   

CDF
Short for channel definition format, an XML specification developed by Microsoft that allows Web publishers to push content at users. Once a user subscribes to a CDF channel, any software that supports the CDF format will automatically receive new content posted on the channel's Web server. Microsoft submitted CDF as a Note to the W3C in 1997 and it has since become a .

CDFS
Short for CD-ROM File System, the Windows 95 driver for CD-ROM players. CDFS replaces MSCDEX, which was used for DOS and Windows 3.x systems. Unlike MSCDEX, which is a 16-bit program that runs only in real mode, CDFS is a 32-bit program that runs in protected mode. In addition, it uses the VCACHE driver to control the CD-ROM disk cache, which results in much smoother playback. 

CDI
Short for Customer Data Integration, it is the combination of the technology, processes, and services needed to create and maintain an accurate, timely and complete view of the customer across multiple channels, business lines, and, potentially, enterprises, where there are multiple sources of customer data in multiple application systems and databases. [Adapted from Gartner Research] 

CDMA
Short for Code-Division Multiple Access, a digital cellular technology that uses spread-spectrum techniques. Unlike competing systems, such as GSM, that use TDMA, CDMA does not assign a specific frequency to each user. Instead, every channel uses the full available spectrum. Individual conversations are encoded with a pseudo-random digital sequence.
CDMA consistently provides better capacity for voice and data communications than other commercial mobile technologies, allowing more subscribers to connect at any given time, and it is the common platform on which 3G technologies are built.
CDMA is a military technology first used during World War II by English allies to foil German attempts at jamming transmissions. The allies decided to transmit over several frequencies, instead of one, making it difficult for the Germans to pick up the complete signal. Because Qualcomm created communicationschips for CDMA technology, it was privy to the classified information. Once the information became public, Qualcomm claimed patents on the technology and became the first to commercialize it.

CDMA2000
Another name for 1xRTT.

CDN
CDN is short for content delivery network.
A content delivery network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver webpages and other Web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and a content delivery server.
This service is effective in speeding the delivery of content of websites with high traffic and websites that have global reach. The closer the CDN server is to the user geographically, the faster the content will be delivered to the user. CDNs also provide protection from large surges in traffic.

CDP
Abbreviated as CDP and also called continuous backup, continuous data protection refers to backing up computer data by saving as an automated function a copy every time changes are made to that data. It allows users to restore files that are corrupted or that have been accidentally deleted, back to any point in time before they were lost.
There are three types of CDP systems:

Block-based CDP: logical time-ordered cache of all block-writes across the storage network.
Application-based CDP: operates from within the specific application being protected.
File-based CDP: capture file-system data and metadata events.


continuous_data_protection
Abbreviated as CDP and also called continuous backup, continuous data protection refers to backing up computer data by saving as an automated function a copy every time changes are made to that data. It allows users to restore files that are corrupted or that have been accidentally deleted, back to any point in time before they were lost.
There are three types of CDP systems:

Block-based CDP: logical time-ordered cache of all block-writes across the storage network.
Application-based CDP: operates from within the specific application being protected.
File-based CDP: capture file-system data and metadata events.


CDPD
Short for Cellular Digital Packet Data, a data transmission technology developed for use on cellular phone frequencies. CDPD uses unused cellular channels (in the 800- to 900-MHz range) to transmit data in packets. This technology offers data transfer rates of up to 19.2 Kbps, quicker call set up, and better error correction than using modems on an analog cellular channel.  

CDR
Short for Compact Disk-Recordable drive, a type of disk drive that can create CD-ROMs and audio CDs. This allows users to "master" a CD-ROM or audio CD for publishing. Until recently, CD-R drives were quite expensive, but prices have dropped dramatically.  A feature of many CD-R drives, called multisession recording, enables you to keep adding data to a CD-ROM over time. This is extremely important if you want to use the CD-R drive to create backup CD-ROMs.  To create CD-ROMs and audio CDs, you'll need not only a CD-R drive, but also a CD-R software package. Often, it is the software package, not the drive itself, that determines how easy or difficult it is to create CD-ROMs.  CD-R drives can also read CD-ROMs and play audio CDs.  

cdrdao
Open source software (released under the GPL) for recording compact discs. cdrdao records audio or data CD-Rs in disk-at-once (DAO) mode, based on a textual description of the CD contents. cdrdao program is run from the command line and has no GUI.

CE
Short for consumer electronics.

consumer_electronics
Consumer electronics refers to any device containing an electronic circuit board that is intended for everyday use by individuals. This encompasses a massive category of electronics that includes televisions, cameras, digital cameras, PDAs, calculators, VCRs, DVDs, clocks, audio devices, headphones, tablets, smartphones and many other home products.

CE_ATA
CE-ATA is a derivative of the ATA storage specification for CE (consumer electronics) equipment. The CE-ATA design is smaller and more power efficient than current technologies, making it a better choice for devices like portable audio players, handhelds, and mobile phones. From an industry perspective the benefits of CE-ATA are many. The CE-ATA standard is expected to benefit disk drive suppliers, silicon providers, product integrators, and consumers. This initiative to define a storage interface tailored to the unique needs of handheld and portable consumer electronic devices is being led by Intel Corporation, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, Marvell Semiconductor Inc., Seagate Technology and Toshiba America Information Systems. The specification is scheduled to be completed in the first half of 2005, with the first end products supporting CE-ATA becoming available several months after.

CECO
Short for Chief Environmental Commitment Officer, CECO is the job title of a person within a corporation who is responsible for the implementation and management of the corporation's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint. In some corporations the CECO may be called a Chief Green Officer (CGO). See also "Getting Started With Green Computing" in Webopedia's Did You Know...? section.

CEE
Short for Converged Enhanced Ethernet, CEE is an enhanced single interconnect Ethernet technology designed to enable the convergence of various applications in data centers, such as LAN, SAN and HPC. These applications are designed for transport over existing storage networks with a high throughput and low-latency communication. CEE may also be called Data Center Ethernet, or it may be referred to as DCE by Cisco.

cel_animation
A traditional form of animation used in the production of cartoons or animated movies where each frame of the scene is drawn by hand. A full-length feature film produced using cel animation would often require a million or more drawings to complete.


Celeron
A brand name for a line of Intel microprocessors introduced in June, 1998. Celeron chips are based on the same P6 architecture as the Pentium II microprocessor, but are designed for low-cost PCs. They run at somewhat lower clock speeds (266 and 300 MHz) and are not as expandable as Pentium II microprocessors. 

cell
(1) In spreadsheet applications, a cell is a box in which you can enter a single piece of data. The data is usually text, a numeric value, or a formula. The entire spreadsheet is composed of rows and columns of cells. A spreadsheet cell is analogous to a field in database management systems.  Individual cells are usually identified by a column letter and a row number. For example, D12specifies the cell in column D and row 12.
 (2) In communications and networking, a fixed-size packet of data.
 (3) In cellulartelephone systems, a geographic area.

Cell_on_Wheels
Often referred to as a COW, Cell on Wheels is a portable base station, usually a large truck or a van that is used to provide temporary wireless network capacity. COWs are typically used during special events where a larger number of people will converge on one area, or in disaster areas if the base station has been damaged. The COW vehicle will consist of a cellular tower and all the support equipment  needed to provide mobile wireless communications.

cell_relay
A data transmission technology based on transmitting data in relatively small, fixed-size packets or cells. Each cell contains only basic path information that allows switching devices to route the cell quickly. Cell relay systems can reliably carry live video and audio because cells of fixed size arrive in a more predictable way than systems with packets or frames of varying size.  Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is the cell relay standard set by the CCITT organization. ATM uses a cell of 53 bytes.  

cellphone
Same as mobile phone.

cellphone_novel
A published book that is based on and largely contains text messaging sentences as they were typed out on a cellphone. Cellphone novels are usually authored by women, are in the first person and are read like a personal diary. Cellphone novels are popular in Japan, because the nature of the Japanese language, where a complete sentence in Japanese can be a single verb, is more compatible with short text messaging sentences. Also see the page of text messaging abbreviations in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia. 

cellphone_plate
See under faceplate.

cellphone_virus
A cellphone (also called a mobile phone) virus is the equivalent to a computer virus, only it infects consumer cellphones and spreads by way of MMS  attachments, Bluetooth transfers, and Internet downloads. The most common type of cellphone virus is one that travels from computers to cellphones by way of infected files that are  downloaded from the Internet. However cellphone-to-cellphone viruses, while less common, do exist. The first known cellphone virus was called Cabir and was detected in June 2004 by Kaspersky Labs. The Cabir worm was coded to infect Symbian OS cellphones. Cabir was designed to scan for all accessible phones using Bluetooth technology, and send a copy of itself to the first one found. Setting your phone into a non-discoverable (hidden) Bluetooth mode will protect your phone from the Cabir worm. But, once the phone is infected it will try to infect other systems even if you try to disable Bluetooth from system settings. In 2005 Cabir's  source code became widely available on the Internet.

Cells_In_Frames
A specification that enables ATM cells to be carried in Ethernet packets. This makes it possible to implement the ATM protocol while using existing Ethernet equipment, especially network interface cards (NICs). CIF provides the advantages of ATM, such as Quality of Service (QoS), without the usual hardware expense. 

cellular
(sel´ū-l&r) (adj.) Refers to communications systems, especially the Advance Mobile Phone Service (AMPS), that divide a geographic region into sections, called cells. The purpose of this division is to make the most use out of a limited number of transmission frequencies. Each connection, or conversation, requires its own dedicated frequency, and the total number of available frequencies is about 1,000. To support more than 1,000 simultaneous conversations, cellular systems allocate a set number of frequencies for each cell. Two cells can use the same frequency for different conversations so long as the cells are not adjacent to each other.  For digital communications, several competing cellular systems exist, including GSM and CDMA.  

CELP
Short for Card Edge Low Profile, the socket into which COAST circuit boards are plugged.

censorware
A category of software that is also referred to as Internet blocking or Internet filtering software. Censorware limits the user' access to content on the Internet. The term is often used pejoratively as it implies that certain Internet content is being censored from the user, not filtered. Libraries and schools commonly use this type of filtering software to restrict its users from accessing pornography. However, the use of censorware is controversial for a number of reasons, including:


The criteria used to block Web sites is subjective. Someone else is deciding what the users should have access to. There is the potential to discriminate against a community by blocking access to specific sites and information. 
The software typically relies on natural language keywords to block sites that contain those words. Many words have multiple meanings depending on the context in which they are used. Web sites that use words in a different sense than the way they are used in blocked sites will be rendered inaccessible by the software. The software also keeps a "blacklist" of sites that it will not allow the user to access. 
A high margin for error in filtering sites that mistakenly are filtered. 
Critics of the software argue that parents rely on this flawed system to monitor what they themselves should be monitoring for their children.



center_channel
In a surround sound system the center channel refers to the channel which produces the audio which should come from directly in front of the viewer from a center front location.

central_tunneling
In VPN technology, central tunneling is the process of forcing all traffic from a remote VPN through a central site. Central tunneling allows additional security as remote VPN users are protected by a firewall at the central site, and also enables NAT, IDS, IPS and anti-virus and spam filtering. Central tunneling does increase bandwidth at the central site. See also tunneling and split tunneling.

centralized_network
A type of network where all users connect to a central server, which is the acting agent for all communications. This server would store both the communications and the user account information. Most public instant messaging platforms use a centralized network. Also called centralized server-structure.

centrex
Short for central office exchange service, a type of PBX service in which switching occurs at a local telephone station instead of at the company premises. Typically, the telephone company owns and manages all the communications equipment necessary to implement the PBX and then sells various services to the company. 

Centronics_interface
A standard interface for connecting printers and other parallel devices. Although Centronics Corporation designed the original standard, the Centronics interface used by modern computers was designed by Epson Corporation. For PCs, almost all parallel ports conform to the Centronics standard. Two new parallel port standards that are backward compatible with Centronics, but offer faster transmission rates, are ECP (Extend Capabilities Port) and EPP (Enhanced Parallel Port).   

CER
(ē´kw&l er´&r rāt) (n.) Abbreviated as EER. A biometric security system predetermines the threshold values for its false acceptance rate and its false rejection rate, and when the rates are equal, the common value is referred to as the equal error rate. The value indicates that the proportion of false acceptances is equal to the proportion of false rejections. The lower the equal error rate value, the higher the accuracy of the biometric system.  Also referred to as crossover rate or crossover error rate (CER).

CERN
Pronounced sern. Short for Conseil Europeen pour le Recherche Nucleaire (European Laboratory for Particle Physics), a research laboratory headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and funded by many different countries. While most work deals with nuclear physics, the CERN is known for Tim Berners-Lee's pioneering work in developing the World Wide Web portion of the Internet.

CERTCC
Short for the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center. CERT was started in December 1988 by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which was part of the U.S. Department of Defense, after the Morris Worm disabled about 10% of all computers connected to the Internet. CERT/CC is located at the Software Engineering Institute, a federally funded research center operated by Carnegie Mellon University.   Cert/CC studies Internet security vulnerabilities, provides services to Web sites that have been attacked and publishes security alerts. CERT/CC's research activities include the area of WAN computing and developing improved Internet security. The organization also provides training to incident response professionals. 

certificate_bandit
A hacker that breaks into a Certificate Authority (CA) company in order to issue fake certificates that help bogus websites masquerade as authentic sites such as Google, Skype and Microsoft.
Certificate bandits were responsible for two major certificate breaches in 2011, when the Comodo and DigiNotar CAs were both duped into issuing fake certificates. The potential damage from the work of certificate bandits is often mitigated by the major Web browser vendors like Microsoft, Mozilla and Apple issuing updates to their browsers that block the fake certificates issued by the hacked CAs.  In order to prevent damage from certificate bandits, though, this does require that users keep their browsers updated with the latest releases and patches.

certification
In computer-based training (CBT) also called computer-assisted instruction (CAI), certification refers to both the program and the process a student must go through to obtain certification in the studied area. Certification also includes testing and assessment that must be met by the learner with a minimum acceptable score.  See also "Computer Certifications" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia. 

certification_authority
Abbreviated as CA, a trusted third party organization or company that issues digital certificates used to create digital signatures and public-private key pairs. The role of the CA in this process is to guarantee that the individual granted the unique certificate is, in fact, who he or she claims to be. Usually, this means that the CA has an arrangement with a financial institution, such as a credit card company, which provides it with information to confirm an individual's claimed identity. CAs are a critical component in data security and electronic commerce because they guarantee that the two parties exchanging information are really who they claim to be.
Also referred to as a certificate authority.
 

Certified_eBay_Solutions_Provider
When choosing a third-party eBay applications or  hosted services, you can verify the application works with the eBay platform by checking for eBay certified logos. Applications (or Web sites) displaying the Certified eBay Solutions Provider logo have met a higher level of certification than those verified as an eBay Compatible Application. Certified Providers are screened and eBay requires that these developers have extensive experience with eBay, pass a strict certification exam and provide a number of proven customer references.  See also eBay Compatible Application.

Certified_Information_Systems_Security_Professional_CISSP
Issued by (ISC)2, the Certified Information Systems Security Professional  (CISSP) certification provides  information security professionals with an objective measurement of competence  as well as a globally recognized standard of achievement. CISSP certification  means the information security professional demonstrates a working knowledge of  information security, confirms commitment to the profession and establishes  a standard of best  practices. The Certified Information Systems Security Professional  (CISSP) certification is accredited by the ANSI (American National  Standards Institute) to ISO (International Organization for Standardization) Standard 17024:2003. With the continuous evolution of information security, (ISC)2 offers  concentrated credentials, called CISSP Concentrations. Passing a CISSP  Concentration exam demonstrates that the information security professional has  proven capabilities and subject-matter expertise beyond what is required for the  CISSP credential. These are available in the following areas:


Architecture (CISSP-ISSAP) 
Engineering (CISSP-ISSEP) 
Management (CISSP-ISSMP)

Certified_Wireless_USB
The Wireless USB application is based on WiMedia's Ultra Wideband common radio platform, enabling PC.s, peripherals, consumer electronics and mobile devices to connect using using a common interface at up to 480Mbps at 3 meters. This technology was created by the Wireless USB Promoter Group: Agere Systems, Hewlett Packard, Intel, Microsoft, NEC Electronics, Philips and Samsung. Wireless USB delivers speeds of 480 Mbps at 3 meters (app. 10 feet) and 110 Mbps at 10 meters (appr. 30 feet). At close range the speed rate is the same as for Hi-Speed USB. [Source:  USB.org]

CFM
Short for cubic feet per minute, a measurement of the velocity at which air flows into or out of a space. The CFM measurement often is used in reference to a computer��s cooling system, and more typically in reference to an air-cooling system that is supporting overclocking.

CFML
Short for ColdFusion Markup Language, a proprietary markup language developed by Allaire for use with ColdFusion. CFML is a tag-based Web scripting language supporting dynamic Web page creation and database access in a Web server environment. In the language, ColdFusion tags are embedded in HTML files. The HTML tags determine the page's layout while the CFML tags import content based on user input or the results of a database query. Files created with CFML have the file extension .cfm.

CG
Abbreviated as CG, in video editing a character generator is the software or hardware that produces animated text for insertion in video streams. Some character generators may also be able to generate graphics. Software character generators are often integrated into video-editing applications and are widely available in off-the shelf software packages. Hardware-based character generators are generally used in television production studios.

CGA
Abbreviation of color/graphics adapter, an old graphics  system for PCs. Introduced in 1981 by IBM, CGA was the first color graphics system for IBM PCs. Designed primarily for computer games, CGA does not produce sharp enough characters for extended editing sessions. CGA's highest-resolution mode is 2 colors at a resolution of 640 by 200.  CGA has been superseded by VGA systems. 

CGI
Abbreviation of Common Gateway Interface, CGI is a specification for transferring information between a World Wide Web server and a CGI program. A CGI program is any program designed to accept and return data that conforms to the CGI specification. The program could be written in any programming language, including C, Perl, Java, or Visual Basic.
CGI Programs
CGI programs are the most common way for Web servers to interact dynamically with users. Many HTML pages that contain forms, for example, use a CGI program to process the form's data once it's submitted. Another increasingly common way to provide dynamic feedback for Web users is to include scripts or programs that run on the user's machine rather than the Web server. These programs can be Java applets, Java scripts, or ActiveX controls. These technologies are known collectively as client-side solutions, while the use of CGI is a server-side solution because the processing occurs on the Web server.
One problem with CGI is that each time a CGI script is executed, a new process is started. For busy Web sites, this can slow down the server noticeably. A more efficient solution, but one that it is also more difficult to implement, is to use the server's API, such as ISAPI or NSAPI. Another increasingly popular solution is to use Java servlets.

CGI_form
A CGI form is a way for an Internet user to interact dynamically with a Web server. An HTML page that contains a form may use a CGI program to process the form's data once it has been submitted. For example: a user visits a Web page looking for specific information on a topic and finds that the Web page offers an e-mail newsletter service. In order for the user to receive the newsletter, he must fill out a CGI form with all of his applicable information. The form is then sent to the server using CGI, and the server processes the information that was sent in the form in order to add the user to its database and initiate the user's newsletter service.

CGM
Abbreviation of Computer Graphics Metafile, a file format designed by several standards organizations and formally ratified by ANSI. It is designed to be the standard vector graphics file format and is supported by a wide variety of software and hardware products.  

CGMS
Short for Copy Guard Management System, CGMS is a method of copy protection used to prevent unauthorized disc copying. The Copy Guard Management System first determines if data recorded on a recording medium is original or copied, and then prevents the data from being copied when it is not original. A copy of the original can be made only once, but a copy of data (secondary copy) cannot be copied again. May also be called Single Copy Management System (SCMS).

CGO
Short for Chief Green Officer, CGO is the job title of a person within a corporation who is responsible for the implementation and management of the corporation's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint. In some corporations, the CFO may be called a Chief Environmental Commitment Officer (CECO). See also "Getting Started With Green Computing" in Webopedia's Did You Know...? section.

chad
Confetti-like pieces of paper formed from punch cards or paper tapes. May have been derived from the word Chadless keypunch, which did not create the confetti-like substance; therefore, it was assumed the stuff created must then be called chad.   U.S. Navy teletype machines produced chad from paper tape since before the Korean War. Chad was somewhat of a nuisance because it always got into sailors' hair, clothes, and shoes. On occasion, though, they would throw chad parties for departing sailors in which they would cover their shipmates in chad.   What seems to be jargon may in fact be considered mainstream because it's been reported that the word chad was used (1993) in the directions for a card-based voting machine in California.   

chain_e_mail


challenge_response
(1) A common authentication technique whereby an individual is prompted (the challenge) to provide some private information (the response). Most security systems that rely on smart cards are based on challenge-response. A user is given a code (the challenge) which he or she enters into the smart card. The smart card then displays a new code (the response) that the user can present to log in. (2) In biometrics, challenge response is the term used to describe the method by which the identification of a person is detected based on voluntary or involuntary responses. Challenge response is a type of biometric system security.

change-management-ecm
Change management, also called enterprise change management (ECM), is defined as the process, tools and techniques required by an organization to manage the people-side of change in the enterprise in order to achieve the expected outcome.
Change management is typically needed when a large company or enterprise is preparing to undergo a major transformation and will need to align its people to the organization's new culture, business processes, business goals and values.


channel
(1) A transmission path .
(2) A set of properties that distinguishes one channel from another. For example, TV channels refer to particular frequencies at which radio waves are transmitted. IRC  channels refer to specific discussions.
(3) In sales and marketing, the way in which a vendor communicates with and sells products to consumers.

channel_bank
A channel bank is the foundation for all digital telecommunication transmissions. It is the part of a carrier -multiplex terminal that multiplexes a group of channels into a higher bit-rate digital channel and demultiplexes these aggregates back into individual channels. A channel bank changes analog voice and data signals into a digital format. It is called a "bank" because it can contain enough processing power to convert a bank of up to 24 individual channels to a digital format, and then back to analog again. The 24 channels comprise a T1 circuit.   A channel bank can also multiplex a group of channels into a higher bandwidth analog channel. 

channel_bonding
A technology that combines two telephone lines into a single channel, effectively doubling the data transfer speeds. To take advantage of channel bonding, you need two modems and two telephone lines. If both modems offer 56 Kbps speeds, for example, bonding two modems together would give you a 112 Kbps Internet connection, comparable to an ISDN connection. 

channel_captain
The name given to the chief individual or company responsible for overseeing a channel and its channel partners. A channel captain would organize the channel and prevent or handle any issues and conflict within the channel and also largely decide the products and services that are distributed throughout the channel.

channel_partner
The name used to describe a company that partners with a manufacturer or producer to market and sell the manufacturer's products, services, or technologies- usually through a co-branding relationship. Channel partners may be distributors, vendors, retailers, consultants, systems integrators (SI), technology deployment consultancies, and value-added resellers (VARs) and other organizations. See also channel.

channel_strategy
The term used to describe the method that controls the flow of goods and services from the manufacturer to the end-user. See also channel.

CHAP
Short for Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol, a type of authentication in which the authentication agent (typically a network server) sends the client program a random value that is used only once and an ID value. Both the sender and peer share a predefined secret. The peer concatenates the random value (or nonce), the ID and the secret and calculates a one-way hash using MD5. The hash value is sent to the authenticator, which in turn builds that same string on its side, calculates the MD5 sum itself and compares the result with the value received from the peer. If the values match, the peer is authenticated.  By transmitting only the hash, the secret can't be reverse-engineered. The ID value is increased with each CHAP dialogue to protect against replay attacks.  Contrast with PAP.

chapel
Chapel is a parallel programming language, designed to make parallel programming more productive, from high-end supercomputers to commodity clusters and multi-core desktops and laptops.
Chapel Principles and Features
According to the information provide don the Chapel website, the programming language is designed from principles first, rather than by extending an existing language. Chapel builds on concepts and syntax from many languages, however its parallel features are most directly influenced by ZPL, High-Performance Fortran (HPF), and the Cray MTA/Cray XMT extensions to C and Fortran.


chapter
On DVD movies, a chapter is a marker used for navigation purposes. The movie file is broken into segments, called chapters, and each chapter can be accessed by the main menu on the DVD.

character
In computer  software, any symbol that requires one byte of storage. This includes all the ASCII and extended ASCII characters, including the space character. In character-based software, everything that appears on the screen, including graphics symbols, is considered to be a character. In graphics-based applications, the term character is generally reserved for letters, numbers, and punctuation.


character_animation
In computer animation, character animation is the creation of an animated person or animal. The animator will make a unique character-generated individual and decide how the character will look, move, and interact with its environment.

character_based
Describes programs capable of displaying only ASCII (and extended ASCII) characters. Character-based programs treat a display screen as an array of boxes, each of which can hold one character. When in text mode, for example, PC screens are typically divided into 25 rows and 80 columns. In contrast, graphics-based programs treat the display screen as an array of millions of pixels. Characters and other objects are formed by illuminating patterns of pixels.  Because the IBM extended ASCII  character set includes shapes for drawing pictures, character-based programs are capable of simulating some graphics objects. For example, character-based programs can display windows and menus, bar charts, and other shapes that consist primarily of straight lines. However, they cannot represent more complicated objects that contain curves.  Unlike PCs, the Macintosh computer is a graphics-based machine. All programs that run on a Macintosh computer are graphics based.   

character_generator
Abbreviated as CG, in video editing a character generator is the software or hardware that produces animated text for insertion in video streams. Some character generators may also be able to generate graphics. Software character generators are often integrated into video-editing applications and are widely available in off-the shelf software packages. Hardware-based character generators are generally used in television production studios.

character_mode
Many video adapters support several different modes of resolution. All such modes are divided into two general categories: character mode (also called text mode) and graphics mode. In character mode, the display screen is treated as an array of blocks, each of which can hold one ASCII character. In graphics mode, the display screen is treated as an array of pixels, with characters and other shapes formed by turning on combinations of pixels.  Of the two modes, character mode is much simpler. Programs that run in character mode generally run much faster than those that run in graphics mode, but they are limited in the variety of fonts and shapes they can display. Programs that run entirely in character mode are called character-based programs.   

character_set
A defined list of characters recognized by the computer  hardware and software. Each character is represented by a number. The ASCII character set, for example, uses the numbers 0 through 127 to represent all English characters as well as special control characters. European ISO character sets are similar to ASCII, but they contain additional characters for European languages.


character_string
A series of characters manipulated as a group. A character string differs from a name in that it does not represent anything -- a name stands for some other object.  A character string is often specified by enclosing the characters in single or double quotes. For example, WASHINGTON would be a name, but 'WASHINGTON' and "WASHINGTON" would be character strings.  The length of a character string is usually the number of characters in it. For example, the character string "WASHINGTON" has a length of 10 (the quote marks are not included). Some programs, however, mark the beginning or end of a character string with an invisible character, so the length might actually be one greater than the number of characters.   

character_treatment
The use of all caps or any standard form of treating letters in a coding or typography project.

charge_back
In electronic commerce, a charge back is a reversal of a credit card transaction, which is usually iniated by the card issuer as requested by the cardholder. It may also be requested by the merchant. Charge backs usually occur due to fraudulent activity on the card (real or perceived), due to customer disputes, or from other authorization issues.

charms

Juju charms can be written in any executable language, and the charms are regularly reviewed, updated and made available for download in Canonical's Juju Charms Store.

Chart_Wizard
A wizard found in the Microsoft Excel program that takes users step-by-step through the process of creating a chart in Microsoft Excel. The Chart Wizard is accessible on the "Insert Menu", then you choose "Chart".
See also wizard.

chassis
Pronounced "CHA-see." Also called case, a metal frame that serves as the structural support for electronic components. Every computer system requires at least one chassis to house the circuit boards and wiring. The chassis also contains slots for expansion boards. If you want to insert more boards than there are slots, you will need an expansion chassis, which provides additional slots.  There are two basic flavors of chassis designs-desktop models and tower models -but there are many variations on these two basic types. 

chassis_intrusion_connector
A connector found on a motherboard that supports a chassis security feature that detects if  a chassis component is removed or replaced, in which case an alarm sound is heard through the onboard speaker or PC chassis speaker if present. For the chassis intrusion circuit to work, the chassis power supply must be connected to AC power. By default, on the motherboard the pin labeled chassis "signal" and "ground" are shorted with a jumper cap. You need to remove the jumper caps if you intend to use the chassis intrusion detection hardware. See also "Motherboards: What You Should Know" in the  Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

chat
Real-time communication between two users via computer. Once a chat has been initiated, either user can enter text by typing on the keyboard and the entered text will appear on the other user's monitor. Most networks and online services offer a chat feature.


chat_abbreviation
Used in real-time text-based communications — such as instant messaging, email, online gaming services, chat rooms, discussion boards and mobile phone text messaging (SMS) — chat abbreviations are acronyms and slang terms used to shorten the amount of text you type when chatting online or on a cellphone. For example, if you are in a chatroom and someone types a funny statement, you could answer with LOL (short for Laughing Out Loud) instead of typing the full phrase out. Chat abbreviations are used in many different online groups and by people of all ages.   Webopedia's "Guide to Understanding Online Chat Acronyms & Smiley Faces" Quick Reference will help you decipher the text chat lingo by providing the definitions to more than 1,180 chat abbreviations.

chat_bot
Short for chat robot, a computer program that simulates human conversation, or chat, through artificial intelligence. Typically, a chat bot will communicate with a real person, but applications are being developed in which two chat bots can communicate with each other. Chat bots are used in applications such as ecommerce customer service, call centers and Internet gaming. Chat bots used for these purposes are typically limited to conversations regarding a specialized purpose and not for the entire range of human communication.
One well known example of a chat bot is ALICE.
A chat bot is also called a chatterbot.

checksum
A simple error-detection scheme in which each transmitted message is accompanied by a numerical value based on the number of set bits in the message. The receiving station then applies the same formula to the message and checks to make sure the accompanying numerical value is the same. If not, the receiver can assume that the message has been garbled.
 

cherry_picker
A hydraulic lift system used on the back of large vehicles and trucks. The system uses a bucket that a worker stands in to be moved up in the air. While used in orchards to allow workers to pick fruit higher up in the trees, a cherry picker is also used on telephone, cable, and other utility service vehicles. It is a common piece of equipment for an ISP. A cherry picker hydraulic system, when mounted onto a truck or large service vehicle is often called a bucket truck.

chicken_boner
A slang term used in reference to an inexperienced spammer. The reference implies that the person is a low-life who spends all their time in front of the computer with "fried chicken bones littering the floor".

chicklet

chiclet_keyboard
A chiclet keyboard refers to  keyboards with elevated keys that have some space between them in a design that enables the keys to blend into the surrounding area of the keyboard.  A chiclet keyboard's keys are rectangular in shape with rounded edges as compared to the slanted-edge keys featured in traditional keyboards.  One main advantage to a chiclet keyboard is that with the keys having a slightly larger area there's a smaller chance of hitting the wrong key.
Chiclet keyboards get their name from the "Chiclets" brand of rectangular-shaped chewing gum.  The chiclet keyboard design has become more popular recently, especially in netbooks and notebooks, and is prominently used in Apple MacBooks and Asus laptops.  At the same time, there are many critics of the look and feel of chiclet keyboards.

chief_river
A codename for Intel Ivy Bridge processors developed specifically for tablet, ultrabook and Mac laptop computers.  Chief River processors are designed to succeed the "Huron River" Sandy Bridge processors used in earlier ultrabook models, and offer native support for USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt.
Additional requirements for Chief River ultrabooks include a minimum battery life of 5 hours, at least 16GB of SSD storage and the ability to "wake up" in less than seven seconds.  Recommendations beyond the specified requirements include touch screen support, WiDi, GPS, an accelerometer, and an ambient light sensor (ALS) and proximity sensor.

child_domain
(chīil dō-mān´) (n.) Another name for subdomain.

chiller
Also called a data center chiller, it's a cooling infrastructure used in a data centers and industrial facilities. A chiller cooling system removes heat from one element and deposits into another element. In large data centers the chiller is used to cool the water used in their heating, ventilation and air-conditioning units. Due to the amount of heat produced by many servers and systems in a data center, the chiller cooling system would be operational around-the-clock. As such, a large percentage of the electricity consumed in a data center is used by the chiller.

chip
)A small piece of semiconducting material (usually silicon) on which an integrated circuit is embedded. A typical chip is less than ��-square inches and can contain millions of electronic components (transistors). Computers consist of many chips placed on electronic boards called printed circuit boards.
There are different types of chips. For example, CPU chips (also called microprocessors) contain an entire processing unit, whereas memorychips contain blank memory.
Chips come in a variety of packages. The three most common are:

chip_creep
Mainly referenced to older computer systems.
Chip creep refers to the problem of chips that, over time, would work their way out of the socket. Chip creep occurred due to thermal expansion; the contracting and expanding during system heat up and cool down. While chip creep was most common with older memory modules it was a problem with other main chips that were inserted into sockets. To fix chip creep, users of older systems would often have to remove the case cover and push the loose chip back into the socket.
Today's systems are not affected so much by chip creep since chips are mainly soldered into place or are more securely held by various types of retainer clips.

chip_jewelry

HTML clipboard
&lt;!--
.style1 {
	color: #FF0000;
}
--&gt;
A  slang term used to describe out-dated or scrapped electronics turned into  decorative pieces. For example, last year's fastest CPU is "chip jewelry" when  you upgrade to this year's new processor.

chip_multithreading
Abbreviated as CMT, chip multithreading is the capability of a processor to process multiple software threads and supports simultaneous hardware threads of execution. CMT is achieved by having multiple cores on a single chip (to share chip resources such as, the memory controller and the L2 cache) or multiple threads on a single core.

chips_and_salsa
 Slang term used to mean hardware and software.

chipset
A number of integrated circuits designed to perform one or more related functions. For example, one chipset may provide the basic functions of a modem while another provides the CPU functions for a computer. Newer chipsets generally include functions provided by two or more older chipsets. In some cases, older chipsets that required two or more physical chips can be replaced with a chipset on one chip.
The term is often used to refer to the core functionality of a motherboard.


chkdsk
Short for check disk, chkdsk is a command run utility that is used on DOS and  Microsoft Windows-based systems to check the file system and status of the system's hard drives. The chkdsk command lists and corrects errors on the disk. Used without parameters, chkdsk will display the status of the disk in the current drive. The parameters are as follows:  drive : (specifies the drive that you want to chkdsk) /p (Performs an exhaustive check) /r (locates bad sectors and recovers readable information. Implies /p)  On a Unix-based system, the equivalent utility is called fsck.

CHMOD
Short for change mode, a UNIX command that changes the access permissions of files or directories in order to read, write or execute files.

choke_packet
A specialized packet that is used for flow control along a network. A router detects congestion by measuring the percentage of buffers in use, line utilization and average queue lengths. When it detects congestion, it sends choke packets across the network to all the data sources associated with the congestion. The sources respond by reducing the amount of data they are sending.

choose
To pick a command or option. To choose a menu command or command button in a graphical user interface, you click on it. The terms choose and select   are often used interchangeably, but some authors make a distinction between choosing, which actually activates a command, and selecting, which merely highlights a command or other object.   

Chooser
A Macintosh desk accessory (DA) that enables you to select and configure printers and network devices, such as file servers.  

chroma_bug
Slang name for a Chroma Upsampling Error (CUE). The chroma bug is the tiny horizontal streaks of incorrect coloration that often occur with DVD players. These streaks show along the top and bottom edges of color patches and may also show up during playback as indentations along diagonal color boundaries giving a serrated or comb like edge.  [Adapted from DVD Chroma Upsampling Error, Simplified] 

chroma_key
In graphics and digital video editing programs, chroma key is a function that renders a specific color in a layer transparent.  In television and film, it's the technique of using a monochromatic background for the purpose of replacing it with a different image or scene in post-production. In the film industry it's called blue screen.

chroma_noise
In digital photography and digital video, chroma noise are fluctuations in color and luminance. Chroma noise is unnatural in appearance in the image or video. Noise reduction software can be used reduce both chroma noise.

chromatic_aberration
In digital photography chromatic aberration refers to a defect in some optical lens systems that adds false color to images. These colors usually take the form of a light purple halo around the observed object. Also called purple fringing.

chromatic_dispersion
In fiber optic transmissions, chromatic dispersion is a term used to describe the spreading of a light pulse as it travels down a fiber when  light pulses launched close together (high data rates) spread too much and result in errors and a loss of information. Chromatic dispersion can be compensated for with the use of dispersion-shifted fiber (DSF).

Chrome
(1) Short for Google Chrome browser. (2) Short for Google Chrome operating system. See  Google Chrome: From Browser to Operating System" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia.See also "All About Web Browsers" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia. 

Chrome_OS
The Google Chrome Operating System (Chrome OS) was announced by Google nine months after it released the Chrome browser. Google Chrome OS is described as a lightweight operating system that will make its debut targeting netbook and mobile devices.
The OS, which is the Google Chrome Web browser running within a new windowing system on top of a Linux kernel, is expected to be able to run on x86 as well as ARM chips. Google is expected to open source the code in 2009, and netbooks running the Google Chrome OS will be available for consumers in the second half of 2010.The Google Chrome OS will soon have competition from Firefox OS, a similar lightweight, open source operating system built on the Linux kernel.  The Mozilla operating system project started out under the Boot to Gecko name, and devices powered by the Firefox OS are expected to start appearing in early 2013.
See also "Google Chrome: From Browser to Operating System" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia.

chromebook
Chromebook is a new category of notebook computers and mobile devices that runs Google’s cloud-based Chrome OS operating system.  While they lack the processing power and higher-end features of standard laptops, Chromebooks are built primarily for Web surfing and are optimized for this purpose with the Google Chrome Web browser as well as near instant-on and instant-resume capabilities.
The first retail Chromebooks have been produced by Samsung and Acer and feature both Wi-Fi and 3G capabilities, Intel Atom processors, 2 GB RAM, 16 GB SSDs for storage, and either a 11.6-inch (Acer) or 12.1-inch 1280x800 (Samsung) screen.
See also "What is Google Chromebook" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia.

chromeless
A Mozilla Labs project developed to remove and replace the traditional Web browser user interface with a more flexible platform that enables new browser user interfaces using Web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In short, Chromeless (currently inactive) is designed to enable developers to build desktop applications with common Web development technologies. 
The Chromeless project is a more ambitious undertaking that takes over for Mozilla Labs’ recently retired Prism project, which allowed users to create desktop-like apps from individual websites. Chromeless utilizes the Python programming language and the same rendering engine found in the Mozilla Firefox 4 Web browser, and is available for major operating systems such as Mac OS X (v10.5 and later), Microsoft Windows (Windows XP and later) and most versions of Linux.
Chromeless is not affiliated with Google nor does it share any relation with the company’s Google Chrome Web browser.

chromium
Chromium refers to a pair of open-source projects that power the Google Chrome Web browser and Google Chrome OS. The Chromium project's mission is to build an interface for users to experience the Web in a way that's "faster, safer, and more stable than existing alternatives." The Chromium OS project, on the other hand, aims to develop a Web-focused operating system and computing experience that's "fast, simple, and secure."
Chromium browser releases are designed to run on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and ChromeOS operating systems. While Chromium releases parallel those of Google Chrome releases, Chromium downloads are distinguished from Google Chrome browser downloads by the lack of Google's branding, the GoogleUpdate automatic updating system, an integrated Adobe Flash Player and sandboxed PDF viewer, and usage statistics and crash reporting options. 
The project also offers extensive documentation and source code for developers interested in exploring and/or contributing to the project. The Chromium project's name is derived from the element chromium, which is the metal used to make chrome.

chromium_os
Chromium and Chromium OS refer to a pair of open-source projects that power the Google Chrome Web browser and Google Chrome OS, respectively. The Chromium OS project aims to develop a Web-focused operating system and computing experience that's "fast, simple and secure," while the Chromium project's mission is to build an interface for users to experience the Web that's "faster, safer, and more stable than existing alternatives."
The Chromium OS operating system is based on Linux and is designed to run on only specifically designed hardware such as Chromebooks. The Chromium OS offers a user interface that's similar to the Google Chrome browser, and in addition to its heavy focus on the Web experience, the Chromium OS also relies extensively on cloud-based applications.
The Chromium OS project also offers extensive documentation and source code for developers interested in exploring and/or contributing to the project.

CHRP
Pronounced chirp. Short for Common Hardware Reference Platform, a specification for PowerPC -based machines that can run the Mac OS, Windows NT, or AIX. First released in 1996, CHRP was supposed to make it possible for computer vendors to build Macintosh clones as well as PowerPC-based NT computers.
CHRP is also called the PowerPC Platform (PPCP).

cHTML
(pronounced as separate letters) Short for compact HTML, a subset of HTML for small information devices, such as smart phones and PDAs. cHTML is essentially a pared down version of regular HTML over the Internet. Because small devices such as cellular phones have hardware restrictions such as small memory, low power CPUs, limited or no storage capabilities, small mono-color display screens, single-character font and restricted input methods (the absence of a keyboard or a mouse), there is a need for a simpler form of HTML.  Because of the limitations of small information devices, cHTML does not support JPEG images, tables, image maps, multiple fonts and styles of fonts, background colors and images, frames, style sheets and more than two colors, typically black and white.  cHTML is defined so that all the basic operations can be done by a combination of four buttons and not by two-dimensional cursor movement: cursor forward, cursor backward, select, and back/stop. The functions that require two-dimensional cursor pointing, like "image map" and "table," are excluded from cHTML.  cHTML was created by Japan-based Access Company, Ltd. for use in i-mode devices, and was accepted by the W3CM in 1998. cHTML has been fading into obsolescence as XHTML gains acceptance and replaces cHTML.

chunk
Also called a data chunk, by RFC2960 SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) standards it is the term used to describe a unit of information within an SCTP packet that contains either control information or user data. Also see The OSI Reference Model - Understanding Layers" in the  Did You Know...? section of Webopedia.

churn
In e-mail marketing, churn is the percentage of your subscriber list e-mail addresses that unsubscribe or bounce over a set length of time.

CICS
Short for Customer Information Control System, a TP monitor from IBM that was originally developed to provide transaction processing for IBM mainframes. It controls the interaction between applications and users and lets programmers develop screen displays without detailed knowledge of the terminals being used.  CICS is also available on non-mainframe platforms including the RS/6000, AS/400 and OS/2 -based PCs. 

CIDR
Short for Classless Inter-Domain Routing, an IP addressing scheme that replaces the older system based on classes A, B, and C. With CIDR, a single IP address can be used to designate many unique IP addresses. A CIDR IP address looks like a normal IP address except that it ends with a slash followed by a number, called the IP network prefix.For example:
172.200.0.0/16
The IP network prefix specifies how many addresses are covered by the CIDR address, with lower numbers covering more addresses. An IP network prefix of /12,for example, can be used to address 1,048,576 former Class C addresses.

CIE_color_model
(n.) A color model based on human perception developed by the CIE (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage) committee. While widely regarded as the most accurate color model, CIE is unsuitable for many technologies, including color printing and color monitors. Consequently, these systems need to use other color models, such as CMYK and RGB.

CIFS
Short for Common Internet File System, a protocol that defines a standard for remote file access using millions of computers at a time. With CIFS, users with different platforms and computers can share files without having to install new software.
CIFS runs over TCP/IP but uses the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol found in Microsoft Windows for file and printer access; therefore, CIFS will allow all applications, not just Web browsers, to open and share files across the Internet.
With CIFS, changes made to a file are simultaneously saved on both the client and server side.

CIM
Short for Common Information Model, an industry standard, developed by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF), for describing data about applications and devices so that administrators and software management programs can control applications and devices on different platforms in the same way, ensuring interoperability across a network.  Using techniques of object-oriented programming, CIM provides a consistent definition and structure of data, including expressions for elements such as object classes, properties, associations and methods.  For example, if an enterprise bought four different servers from four different vendors, and networked them together, using CIM the administrator can view the same information about each of the devices, such as manufacturer and serial number, the device��s model number, its location on the network, its storage capacity, and its relationship to the applications that run throughout the network.  Similar and simpler standards, SNMP and DMI, are still in use.

Cineform
A high-quality video production  codec that works on both Mac and PCs and can scale from standard-definition to 4k film resolution. Cineform is a wavelet codec (not a DCT codec) that is often used as a digital intermediary codec for editing video captured in formats like HDV that, because of the way they're compressed, are difficult to edit on many systems. See also "A Complete Guide to Video Codecs" on WebVideoUniverse.com.

Cinema_Craft_Encoder
Abbreviated as CCE, Cinema Craft Encoder is an MPEG1/2 encoder manufactured by Custom Technology. Supported input files include AVI or QuickTime and DV files. Output is DVD or SCVD (MPEG2 compliant) or VCD (MPEG-1 compliant) streams.

Cinepak
A popular codec (compression/decompression technology) for computer video developed by SuperMac Inc.   

cinammon
A desktop graphics environment for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Cinnamon is a fork of the GNOME 3 desktop environment that features a traditional layout similar to GNOME 2 but with GNOME 3's more modern technology and newer features. The mission of Cinnamon is to provide users with an "easy to use and comfortable desktop experience" while also staying current with the latest technology and capabilities.
Cinnamon was developed by Clement Lefebvre, who also created and continues to develop the Linux Mint distribution of Linux.  Linux Mint has also partnered on development of a somewhat similarly focused GNOME-based desktop environment known as MATE.  But while MATE is built on a GNOME 2 foundation, only the desktop layout of Cinnamon is similar to GNOME 2 -- the underlying technology for Cinnamon is based on GNOME 3. 
Cinnamon can be installed in Linux Mint and operate alongside the GNOME 2-based MATE desktop environment as well as GNOME 3 with Mint GNOME Shell Extensions (MGSE), a set of desktop layer components developed by Linux Mint that sits on top of GNOME 3.

CIO
Short for Chief Information Officer, CIO is a job title given to someone within an enterprise who heads, at the executive board level, information technology within an organization. The CIO is largely responsible for the computer systems and the information technology (IT) that support the organization, and works within the organization's budget to oversee the IT implementation, often reporting to the organization's CFO (Chief Financial Officer). Within the organization, the job of a CIO is to overall derive greater demonstrable business value from IT spent. CIO is a job title that is most commonly used in the military, enterprise and larger business organizations.

CIPA
Short for the Children's Internet Protection Act, signed into law in December 2000. CIPA is designed to safeguard children against objectionable or harmful material on the Internet. CIPA amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and the Communications Act of 1934. The amendments direct schools and libraries to have in place a policy of Internet safety and a technology-based method of blocking access to visual depictions on the Internet that are obscene, child pornography or harmful to minors.  In 1997 the Federal Communications Commission established the Universal Service Fund to guarantee that all schools and libraries had access to affordable Internet access regardless of location or economic condition. Only organizations that are compliant with CIPA can receive Universal Services funding.  The Children's Internet Protection Act is also referred to as the CHIP Act.

cipher_text
Data that has been encrypted. Cipher text is unreadable until it has been converted into plain text (decrypted) with a key.  

CIR
Short for committed information rate, a specified amount of guaranteed bandwidth (measured in bits per second) on a Frame Relay service. Typically, when purchasing a Frame Relay service, a company can specify the CIR level they wish. The Frame Relay network vendor guarantees that frames not exceeding this level will be delivered. It's possible that additional traffic may also be delivered, but it's not guaranteed.  Some Frame Relay vendors offer inexpensive services with a CIR equal to zero. This essentially means that the network will deliver as many frames as it can, but it doesn't guarantee any bandwidth level.  

circuit_switching
A type of communications in which a dedicated channel (or circuit) is established for the duration of a transmission. The most ubiquitous circuit-switching network is the telephone system, which links together wire segments to create a single unbroken line for each telephone call.
The other common communications method is packet switching, which divides messages into packets and sends each packet individually. The Internet is based on a packet-switching protocol, TCP/IP.
Circuit-switching systems are ideal for communications that require data to be transmitted in real-time. Packet-switching networks are more efficient if some amount of delay is acceptable.

CIS
(kon´takt im´ij sen´s&r) (n.) Abbreviated as CIS, a type of optical flatbed scanner that does not use the traditional CCD arrays that rely on a system of mirrors and lenses to project the scanned image onto the arrays. CIS scanners gather light from red, green and blue LEDs (which combine to provide white light) and direct the light at the original document being scanned. The light that is reflected from the original is gathered by a lens and directed at an image sensor array that rests just under the document being scanned. The sensor then records the images according to the intensity of light that hits the sensor.  A CIS scanner is more compact than a CCD scanner and can be used in smaller products than CCD scanning technologies. CIS scanners also require less power than CCD scanners and often can run off battery power or the power from a USB port. CCD scanners, however, provide higher-resolution scans.

CISC
Pronounced sisk, and stands for complex instruction set computer. Most personal computers, use a CISC architecture, in which the CPU supports as many as two hundred instructions. An alternative architecture, used by many workstations and also some personal computers, is RISC (reduced instruction set computer), which supports fewer instructions.  

Cisco_Consumer_Channel_Network
Abbreviated as Cisco CCN, the Cisco Consumer Channel  Network is a is part of Cisco's channel partner program that provides resellers with resources, tools and training for selling the Linksys by Cisco product line of Connected Home Products. The benefits of the Cisco CCN include sales support in addition to providing a variety of sales tools, marketing resources, product information and training via the Cisco CCN Web site, technical support, and more.

Cisco_Discovery_Protocol
The Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) was developed by Cisco Systems. It's primarily used to obtain the protocol addresses of neighboring devices and also to discover the platform of those devices.  It can also be used to show information about the interfaces your router uses. CDP is media and protocol-independent, and runs on all Cisco-manufactured equipment including routers, bridges, access servers, and switches. CDP runs only over the data link layer enabling two systems that support different network-layer protocols to learn about each other. CDP Version-2 (CDPv2) is the most recent release of the protocol and provides more intelligent device tracking features.

Cisco_EnergyWise
 Cisco EnergyWise is a Green IT technology that takes a network-based approach to communicate messages that measure and control energy between network devices and endpoints. With Cisco EnergyWise the network discovers Cisco EnergyWise manageable devices, monitors their power consumption, and takes action based on business rules to reduce power consumption.  Cisco EnergyWise uses a unique domain-naming system to query and summarize information from large sets of devices, making it simpler than traditional network management capabilities. Cisco EnergyWise has a management interface that allow facilities and network management applications to communicate with endpoints and each other using the network as a unifying fabric. The management interface uses standard SNMP or SSL to integrate Cisco and third-party management systems. (Adapted from Cisco EnergyWise)


Cisco_Eos
Short for Cisco Entertainment Operating System, it is a social media networking platform for media and entertainment companies. The platform helps these types of companies create, manage and grow online communities around their content. The platform consists of tools and services for social networking, content management and site administration.

Cisco_Network_Admission_Control
Abbreviated as NAC, Cisco's Network Admission Control is a set of technologies and solutions that use the network infrastructure to enforce security policy compliance on all devices seeking to access network computing resources in order to limit damage from emerging security threats. NAC is designed to allow network access only to compliant and trusted endpoint devices (PCs, servers and PDAs, for example) and can restrict the access of noncompliant devices. NAC assesses all endpoints across all access methods, including LAN, wireless connectivity, remote access and WAN. [Source: Cisco Systems] In October 2006, Cisco and Microsoft formally announced interoperability between the Cisco Network Admission Control (NAC) and Microsoft Network Access Protection (NAP) solutions. Interoperability will be supported with the release of NAP in the future version of Windows Server which is scheduled to be available in the second half of 2007. The interoperability architecture allows customers to deploy both NAC and NAP incrementally or concurrently. See also Microsoft Network Access Protection (NAP). Also see Webopedia's "Did You Know...  All About Network Access Controls".

Cisco_Systems
One of the leading manufacturers of network equipment. Cisco's primary business is in internetworking products, such as routers, bridges, and switches.  

CISSP
(Certification for Information System Security Professional) A certification reflecting the qualifications of information systems security practitioners. The CISSP examination consists of 250 multiple choice questions, covering topics such as Access Control Systems, Cryptography, and Security Management Practices, and is administered by the International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium or (ISC)2 (www.isc2.org). The (ISC)2 promotes the CISSP as an aid to evaluating personnel performing information security functions. The certification was first available in 1989.

citadel_malware
Citadel Trojan is malware created by a malicious code generating program. Citadel was designed to steal personal information, including banking and financial information, from its victims. The Citadel Trojan, based on the Zeus source code, constructs a botnet consisting of a large number of infected computers. The attacker can execute malicious code on an infected computer, including ransomware and scareware.

citizen_journalism
A term used to describe the movement of people and amateur journalists — basically any non-professional journalist — who provide photos, videos and written news pieces on evolving stories, often in collaboration with professional journalists. Also called participatory or public journalism. Citizen journalism is a type of user-generated content.
 

Citrix_server
A server solution that uses Microsoft Terminal Services software to deliver Windows applications to PCs, Apple Macintosh computers, X terminals and UNIX workstations. This enables users of those systems to access and use those programs which are available to those using the Windows operating system. Citrix servers use two technologies; WinFrame and Independent Computing Architecture (ICA).
See ICA. See also WinFrame.


clamping_area
The phrase used to describe the inner hole of a disc. This is the area used by the drive to grip a disc to spin it.

clamping_voltage
The maximum amount of voltage that a surge protector will allow through itself before it will suppress the power surge. When the device reaches its clamping voltage, it blocks any further current from flowing through the device and into a computer system or other electronic device.

clamshell
A clamshell or clamshell mobile is a mobile phone form factor where the phone is divided into two equal halves with a hinge connecting the halves, enabling users to basically fold the phone in half to close when not in use. This type of mobile phone usually has the buttons on the bottom half and the display and speaker on the top half. Some clamshell mobiles may also have a small display on the outside, so when the phone is folded you can view connection details, incoming calls and the date and time without opening the phone. Clamshell phones are more frequently called a flip phone. Flip phone is used in everyday language as a generic term, however Motorola owns the trademark on the term flip phone. See also "The Difference Between a Cell Phone, Smartphone and PDA" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia.

clan
A clan refers to a group of gamers who form a team to compete against others over the Internet in multiplayer games. Clans choose their  team name and will usually set up an initiation process for interested gamers to join their clan via the Internet. Clans use Internet communications such as e-mail, instant messaging, IRC or Internet telephony to communicate and arrange their practices and matches. While a clan is usually focused on one specific multiplayer game, some clans do have divisions to support more than one game.   Clans first became popular in 1996 when id Software released its multiplayer game, Quake. For many years after the release of Quake, clans revolved around multiplayer PC shooter games. With the online multiplayer capabilities of newer consoles however, clans have sprung up for console games which can be played over the Internet as well.In an MMORPG the team or group of gamers is called a guild, rather than a clan.

class
(1) In object-oriented programming, a category of objects. For example, there might be a class called shape that contains objects which are circles, rectangles, and triangles. The class defines all the common properties of the different objects that belong to it.  (2) In .NET languages, classes are templates used for defining new types. Classes describe both the properties and behaviors of objects. Properties contain the data that are exposed by the class. Behaviors are the functionality of the object, and are defined by the public methods (also called member functions) and events of the class. Collectively, the public properties and methods of a class are known as the object interface. Classes themselves are not objects, but instead they are used to instantiate (i.e., create) objects in memory. 

Class_C_network
In a 32-bit IP address, the number of bits used to identify the network and the host vary according to the network class of the address. In a Class C network, the first 3 bits, or the high-order bits, are always "110." The next 21 bits are used to define the Class C network, and the final eight bits are used to identify the host. The IP address is represented in dotted decimal notation of four 8-bit fields, or octets, that have been converted from binary to decimal numbers.

class_library
A collection of prewritten, ready-made software routines that act as templates for programmers to use in writing object-oriented application programs. Class libraries are typically used to provide GUI functions like buttons, scroll bars, icons and windows. Class libraries greatly simplify the work of the programmer who can use the pretested code instead of having to write new code.

Class_Speed_Rating
A defined speed/class rating for Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) memory cards.See SDHC.

classroom_amplification_technology
Abbreviated as CAT, classroom amplification technology is an infrared audio system used in some schools today. Classroom amplification technology creates an environment where each child in the classroom has an equal opportunity to clearly hear the teacher's instruction. CATs are a low-volume amplification system that improves clarity of speech and sound throughout the classroom. The system usually consists of a configurable microphone for the teacher, a base station receiver, and a combination of wall and ceiling speakers. Some CAT systems are also designed for multimedia inputs within the classroom, such as electronic whiteboards, computers, and plasma screens.

clay_animation
Also called claymation, clay animation is a type of stop motion animation that uses clay figures and objects. Cel animation is a 2D animation.

CLDC
Short for Connected Limited Device Configuration. CLDC is the J2ME configuration for smaller handheld devices that are usually battery operated and low in memory with limited processing power and low bandwidth.  Most often the CLDC uses the K virtual machine, which is suitable for devices with 16/32-bit RISC/CISC microprocessors/controllers, and with as little as 160 K of total memory available -- 128 K of which is for the storage of the actual virtual machine and libraries themselves.  CLDC reference implementation and KVM runs on Windows 98/NT, Solaris, and Palm platforms. Developers can access binary releases of the CLDC, or they can get the full release by signing legal forms from Sun.

clean_boot
Starting (booting) a computer as minimalistically as possible. Typically when you start your computer, it loads many files and programs to customize your environment. A clean boot eliminates these optional features and loads only those files and programs that are absolutely required by the operating system.  A clean boot is a troubleshooting technique that allows you to get the computer up and running so that you can perform diagnostic tests to determine which elements of the normal boot process are causing problems. 

clean_computing
A general Green IT term used to describe the process of proper disposal of technology and computer equipment to ensure disposal does not create any harmful environmental waste. See also "Getting Started With Green Computing" in Webopedia's Did You Know...? section.

clean_install
(v.) (1) To install an upgrade of an operating system (OS) on a hard drive that already has an OS running off of it without carrying over any settings of the older OS, such as user preferences or information about the hardware and/or the software.  (2) To install an OS on a hard drive that does not already have an OS installed on it or a newly formatted hard drive.  (n.) The procedure for performing the above actions.

clean_room
A work area in which the air quality, temperature and humidity are highly regulated in order to protect sensitive equipment from contamination. Clean rooms are important features in the production of silicon chips, hard disk drives and other technologies such as satellites. The air in a clean room is repeatedly filtered to remove dust particles and other impurities that can damage the production of highly sensitive technologies.  The measure of the air quality of a clean room is described in Federal Standard 209. Clean rooms are rated as "Class 10,000," where there exists no more than 10,000 particles larger than 0.5 microns in any given cubic foot of air; "Class 1000," where there exists no more than 1000 particles; and "Class 100," where there exists no more than 100 particles. Hard disk drive fabrication requires a Class 100 clean room.  People who work in clean rooms must wear special protective clothing called "bunny suits" that do not give off lint particles and prevent human skin and hair particles from entering the room's atmosphere.

To erase. Clear the screen , for example, means to erase everything on the display screen. Clear a variable  means to remove whatever data is currently stored in the variable. Clear memory means to erase all data currently stored in memory.   

clear_GIF
Also called a Web bug or a pixel tag or a clear GIF. Used in combination with cookies, a Web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, that is placed on a Web site or in an e-mail that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the Web site or sending the e-mail. When the HTML code for the Web beacon points to a site to retrieve the image, at the same time it can pass along information such as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the Web beacon was viewed and for how long, the type of browser that retrieved the image and previously set cookie values.
Web beacons are typically used by a third party to monitor the activity of a site. A Web beacon can be detected by viewing the source code of a Web page and looking for any IMG tags that load from a different server than the rest of the site. Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent Web beacons from tracking the user's activity. The Web beacon will still account for an anonymous visit, but the user's unique information will not be recorded.

Clearing_House_Interbank_Payments_Company
The Clearing House Interbank Payments Company, or CHIPS, is a bank-owned payments system for clearing large value payments. CHIPS is a real-time, final payments system for U.S. dollars and handles more than 95 percent of all dollar payments moving among countries around the world, including foreign trade payments and currency exchanges.

ClearType
A Microsoft technology that is used to improve the appearance of text on your screen. It improves readability on color LCD displays with a digital interface, such as laptops and flat panel displays. Readability on CRT screens can also be somewhat improved. ClearType is included in Windows XP as well as in Microsoft handheld computers.

CLEC
Pronounced see-lek. Short for competitive local exchange carrier, a telephone company that competes with an incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) such as a Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC), GTE, ALLNET, etc.  With the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, there has been an explosion in the number of CLECs. The Act allows companies with CLEC status to use ILEC infrastructure in two ways:   1) Access to UNEs  Important to CLEC telecommunications networking is the availability of unbundled network elements or UNEs (through a collocation arrangement). UNEs are defined by the Act as any "facility or equipment used in the provision of a telecommunications service," as well as "features, functions, and capabilities that are provided by means of such facility or equipment." For CLECs the most important UNE available to them is the local loop, which connects the ILEC switches to the ILEC's present customers. With the local loop, CLECs will be able to connect their switches with the ILEC's switches, thus giving them access to ILEC customers.   2) Resale  Another option open to CLECs is the resale strategy. The Act states that any telecommunications services ILECs offer at retail, must be offered to CLECs at a wholesale discount. This saves the CLEC from having to invest in switches, fiber optic transmission facilities, or collocation arrangements.   In any case, a CLEC may decide on one or the other or even both. CLEC status is very beneficial, especially for ISPs, who may easily get access to the copper loops and other switching elements necessary to provide xDSL services.

clewbie
An Internet slang term that means "clueless newbie".

CLI
(1) Short for command line interface, a user interface common to MS-DOS computers. The user sees the command line on the monitor and a promptthat is waiting to accept instructions from the user. The user types in the command, the computer acts on that command and then issues a new prompt for the next instruction from the user.
CLI operating systems are becoming less used as GUI operating systems gain in popularity. In a GUI operating system, such as Windows, the user responds to graphic images on the screen instead of typing in commands in response to a prompt.
(2) Short for Common Language Infrastructure.

click
(v) To tap on a mouse button, pressing it down and then immediately releasing it. Note that clicking a mouse button is different from pressing (or dragging) a mouse button, which implies that you hold the button down without releasing it. The phrase to click on means to select (a screen object) by moving the mouse pointer to the object's position and clicking a mouse button.  Some operations require a double click, meaning that you must click a mouse button twice in rapid succession. Shift clicking refers to clicking the mouse button while holding the Shift key down.  (n) (1) The pressing down and rapid release of a mouse button.  (2) In the World Wide Web advertising industry, selection of a banner ad by a user. The effectiveness of Web advertisements are measured by their click-through rate - how often people who see the ad click on it. 

click_fraud
Click fraud is an illegal practice that occurs when individuals click on a website's click through advertisements (either banner ads or paid text links) to increase the payable number of clicks to the advertiser. The illegal clicks could either be performed by having a person manually click the advertising hyperlinks or by using automated software or online bots that are programmed to click these banner ads and pay per click text ad links.
Research has indicated that click fraud is perpetrated by individuals who use click fraud to increase their own personal banner ad revenues and also by companies who use click fraud as a way to deplete a competitor's advertising budget. Click fraud is commonly associated with pay-per click advertising (PPC).
Click Fraud or Invalid Clicks?
The phrase invalid clicks is similar to click fraud, however in addition to clicks that is intentionally fraudulent, invalid clicks also includes accidental clicks and other mechanically generated traffic that are not the result of genuine user clicks. Invalid clicks can be a costly for advertisers. Large advertising networks typically analyze and validate clicks on behalf of the advertiser.  When invalid clicks are detected they are flagged and automatically filtered from reports and payments. In some cases, refunds may be issued.

click_wrap
The phrase used to describe a type of purchase or license agreement associated with tangible, shipped goods, for example boxed versions of computer software, or software which is purchased and distributed over the Internet. Like shrink wrap licensing, the click wrap purchase agreement is "bound with the product by plastic wrap (shrink wrap)" and by purchasing the product, removing the shrink wrap and opening the product, the consumer agrees acceptance of the terms and EULA. Where click wrap differs from shrink wrap licensing is on electronically distributed product. Here, a screen or Web page will launch with an "I Agree" button to check and submit before consumers can use the product. See "Is Software Ownership the Same as Licensing?" in Webopedia's "Did You Know...?" section.

click-and-mortar
Click-and-mortar describes a store that exists online and in the physical world. Barnes and Noble is an example of a click-and-mortar store. 

click_through
The process of a visitor clicking on a Web advertisement and going to the advertiser's Web site. Also called ad clicks or requests. The click rate measures the amount of times an ad is clicked versus the amount of times it's viewed. See "How Affiliate Marketing Works" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. Also see Refer-It.com, a directory of referral & affiliate programs for e-commerce, featuring information on over 6,500 affiliate programs.

click_through_rate
Short for click-through rate, the ratio of the number of times a user clicks on an online advertisement per number of viewers who view the Web site that has the advertisement on it. For example, if one out of 100 people who visit a specific Web site click on an advertisement and are taken to the advertiser's site, then the CTR of that advertisement is 1/100, or 1%.


clickjack_attack
Clickjacking, or clickjack attack, is a vulnerability used by an attacker to collect an infected user's clicks. The attacker can force the user to do all sort of things from adjusting the user's computer settings to unwittingly sending the user to Web sites that might have malicious code. Also, by taking advantage of Adobe Flash or JavaScript, an attacker could even place a button under or over a legitimate button, making it difficult for users to detect.  See "You Could be Getting Clickjacked" on internetnews.com. Also see "Technology Terms to Know for 2009" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia.

clickstream
A virtual trail that a user leaves behind while surfing the Internet. A clickstream is a record of a user's activity on the Internet, including every Web site and every page of every Web site that the user visits, how long the user was on a page or site, in what order the pages were visited, any newsgroups that the user participates in and even the e-mail addresses of mail that the user sends and receives. Both ISPs and individual Web sites are capable of tracking a user's clickstream.  Clickstream data is becoming increasingly valuable to Internet marketers and advertisers.

client
(klī´&nt) (n.) The client part of a client-server architecture. Typically, a client is an application that runs on a personal computer or workstation and relies on a server to perform some operations. For example, an e-mail client is an application that enables you to send and receive e-mail.


client_access_license
Short for client access license, CAL is a license that gives a user the right to access the services of the server. CALs are primarily used for Microsoft Server products where the CAL is based on a per seat licensing (also called per user or per device), per server licensing, per processor licensing, or per mailbox licensing.

Client_Application_Services
Client Application Services is the name of the client and services framework provided by ASP.NET 2.0 AJAX Extensions and .NET 3.5 to configure and develop .NET Framework Windows clients that can use ASP.NET application services. Client Application Services enables multiple Windows and Web applications to share user management functionality, such as login, role and profile from a common server.  See also "Client Application Services: Getting Started" on Developer.com.

client_support_manager
A client support manager is expected to administer the delivery of services to clients as well as provide support to business development, client management, and service delivery teams. Serving as a link between business management and clients, a client support manager plays an integral role in business communications.
Client Support Manager Responsibilities
Holders of this position work closely with service development teams, client management teams, and other company stakeholders to ensure services are delivered effectively and efficiently. A client support manager may also be responsible for developing the company customer service policy for an organization.

client_server_architecture
Client-server architecture (client/server) is a network architecture in which each computer or process on the network is either a client or a server. Servers are powerful computers or processes dedicated to managing disk drives (file servers), printers (print servers), or network traffic (network servers ). Clients are PCs or workstations on which users run applications. Clients rely on servers for resources, such as files, devices, and even processing power.
Another type of network architecture is known as a peer-to-peer architecture because each node has equivalent responsibilities. Both client/server and peer-to-peer architectures are widely used, and each has unique advantages and disadvantages.
Client-server architectures are sometimes called two-tier architectures.

client_side
Occurring on the client side of a client-server system. For example, on the World Wide Web, JavaScript scripts are client-side because they are executed by your browser (the client). In contrast, CGI scripts are server-side because they run on the Web server. Java applets can be either server-side or client-side depending on which computer (the server or the client) executes them.  

clip
(1) In computer graphics, to cut off a portion of a graphic at a defined boundary. Most bit-mapped graphics utilities provide a clip feature than enables you to draw a window around an object and clip everything outside of the window.  (2) In video terminology, a clip is a segment of video or media files containing video, audio, graphics or any other content. A clip is defined as having both an in-time and an out-time within a larger video element. Also called a video clip.

clip_art
Electronic illustrations that can be inserted into a document. Many clip-art packages are available, some general and others specialized for a particular field. Most clip-art packages provide the illustrations in several file formats so that you can insert them into various word-processing systems.  

clipboard
A special file or memory area (buffer) where data is stored temporarily before being copied to another location. Many word processors, for example, use a clipboard for cutting and pasting. When you cut a block of text, the word processor copies the block to the clipboard; when you paste the block, the word processor copies it from the clipboard to its final destination. In Microsoft Windows and the Apple Macintosh operating system, the Clipboard (with a capital C) can be used to copy data from one application to another.
The Macintosh uses two types of clipboards. The one it calls the Clipboard can hold only one item at a time and is flushed when you turn the computer off. The other, called the Scrapbook, can hold several items at once and retains its contents from one working session to another.


Clipper_chip
An encryption chip designed under the auspices of the U.S. government. The government's idea was to enforce use of this chip in all devices that might use encryption, including computers, modems, telephones, and televisions. The government would control the encryption algorithm, thereby giving it the ability to decrypt any messages it recovered.
The Goal of Clipper Chip
The purported goal of this plan was to enable the U.S. government to carry out surveillance on enemies of the state even if they used encryption to protect their messages. However, the Clipper chip created a fierce backlash from both public interest organizations and the computer industry in general. The government eventually retracted its original plan but has since promoted two other plans called Clipper 2 and Clipper 3, respectively.
The Clipper 3 plan allows the use of any encryption technology but stipulates that government law enforcement agencies be able to recover any keys exported out of the country.

cloaking
(1) Also known as stealth, a technique used by some Web sites to deliver one page to a search engine for indexing while serving an entirely different page to everyone else. There are opposing views as to whether or not cloaking is ethical. Opponents see it as a bait-and-switch, where a Web server is scripted to look out for search engines that are spidering in order to create an index of search results. The search engine thinks it is selecting a prime match to its request based on the meta tags that the site administrator has input. However, the search result is misleading because the meta tags do not correspond to what actually exists on the page. Some search engines, such as Lycos, Hotbot and Excite, even ban cloaked Web sites. Proponents of cloaking assert that cloaking is necessary in order to protect the meta data, as only the spider is supplied with the meta tags.  Also see How Web Search Engines Work in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia.  (2) In e-mail distribution, cloaking is the act of masking the name and address of the sender so that the recipient does not know who sent the e-mail.

clock_gating
Clock gating is one of the power-saving techniques used on the Pentium 4 processor. To save power, clock gating refers to activating the clocks in a logic block only when there is work to be done. From the earliest days of the Pentium 4 processor design, power consumption was a concern. The clock gating concept isn't a new one; however, the Pentium 4 processor used this technology to a large extent. Every unit on the chip has a power reduction plan, and almost every Functional Unit Block (FUB) contains clock gating logic.

clock_speed
Also called clock rate, the speed at which a microprocessor executes instructions. Every computer contains an internal clock that regulates the rate at which instructions are executed and synchronizes all the various computer components. The CPU requires a fixed number of clock ticks (or clock cycles) to execute each instruction. The faster the clock, the more instructions the CPU can execute per second.
Clock speeds are expressed in megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz ((GHz).
The internal architecture of a CPU has as much to do with a CPU's performance as the clock speed, so two CPUs with the same clock speed will not necessarily perform equally. Whereas an Intel 80286 microprocessor requires 20 cycles to multiply two numbers, an Intel 80486 or later processor can perform the same calculation in a single clock tick. (Note that clock tick here refers to the system's clock, which runs at 66 MHz for all PCs.) These newer processors, therefore, would be 20 times faster than the older processors even if their clock speeds were the same. In addition, some microprocessors are superscalar, which means that they can execute more than one instruction per clock cycle.

clock_tick
Same as a cycle, the smallest unit of time recognized by a device. For personal computers, clock ticks generally refer to the main system clock, which runs at 66 MHz. This means that there are 66 million clock ticks (or cycles) per second. Since modern CPUs run much faster (up to 3 GHz), the CPU can execute several instructions in a single clock tick. 

clock_tripling
The process used on some older 486 computers to triple the internal processing speed of the CPU while maintaining the manufacturer's original clock speed for I/O transfers. In most cases, clock-tripling would normally yield a lower than 100 percent overall system performance boost (e.g., 30 to 70 percent), not an actual tripling of the clock speed as suggested by the name.  See also clock speed.

clone
A computer, software product, or device that functions exactly like another, better-known product. In practice, the term refers to any PC not produced by one of the leading name-brand manufacturers, such as IBM and Compaq. 

Clone_Stamp_tool
In computer graphics software, specifically Adobe Photoshop, the Clone Stamp tool selects and samples an area of your picture and then uses these pixels to paint over any marks. The Clone Stamp tool acts like a brush so you can change the size, allowing cloning from just one pixel wide to hundreds. You can change the opacity to produce a subtle clone effect. Also, there is a choice between Clone align or Clone non-align the sample area. In Photoshop this tool is called Clone Stamp, but it may also be called a Rubber Stamp tool. See also "Photoshop Fundamentals: The Clone Stamp Tool" on  Graphics.com. See also "Graphics Software Terminology" in Webopedia's Quick Reference section.

close
(1) To finish work on a data file and save it.  (2) In graphical user interfaces, to close a window means to exit an application or file, thereby removing the window from the screen.  

Close_to_Metal


closed_loop_reporting
Reporting capability to measure the effectiveness of a particular ad on the Web by tracking which ad viewers actually bought which product, requested a catalog, or took other specific actions on the Web site.

cloud
(1) Also referred to as a network cloud. In telecommunications, a cloud refers to a public or semi-public space on transmission lines (such as T1 or T3) that exists between the end points of a transmission. Data that is transmitted across a WAN enters the network from one end point using a standard protocol suite such as Frame Relay and then enters the network cloud where it shares space with other data transmissions. The data emerges from the cloud -- where it may be encapsulated, translated and transported in myriad ways -- in the same format as when it entered the cloud. A network cloud exists because when data is transmitted across a packet-switched network in a packet, no two packets will necessarily follow the same physical path. The unpredictable area that the data enters before it is received is the cloud.
(2) See also cloud computing.

cloud_app
Short for cloud application, cloud app is the phrase used to describe a software application that is never installed on a local computer. Instead, it is accessed via the Internet.

cloud-app-policy
Cloud app policy refers to policies and procedures put in place by enterprises to ensure that the usage of cloud applications by employees complies with the overall corporate security plan as well as regulatory requirements.
Policies Range From Minimal to Highly Restrictive
The cloud app policies put in place by companies can range from minimal restrictions to highly restrictive, blocking almost all cloud app usage. Many companies have started looking for something in between these two extremes, seeking more fine-grained control of their cloud app policies.
This level of control typically permits use of a wide range of cloud apps but with specific restrictions placed on how and when certain activities can be performed by employees. These types of cloud app policies are designed to protect intellectual property and sensitive data from data loss or leakage from cloud apps without needing to block the usage of apps completely.

cloud_backup
Cloud backup, or cloud computer backup, refers to backing up data to a remote, cloud-based server. As a form of cloud storage, cloud backup data is stored in and accessible from multiple distributed and connected resources that comprise a cloud (see "cloud computing").
Cloud Backup Solutions
Cloud backup solutions enable enterprises or individuals to store their data and computer files on the Internet using a storage service provider, rather than storing the data locally on a physical disk, such as a hard drive or tape backup.
Cloud backup providers enable customers to remotely access the provider's services using a secure client log in application to back up files from the customer’s computers or data center to the online storage server using an encrypted connection.

cloud-backup-solutions
Cloud backup solutions enable enterprises or individuals to store their data and computer files on the Internet using a storage service provider, rather than storing the data locally on a physical disk, such as a hard drive or tape backup.
Backup providers enable customers to remotely access the service using a secure client log in application to back up files from the customer’s computers or data center to the online storage server using an encrypted connection.
How to Restore a Cloud Backup
To update or restore a cloud backup, customers need to use the service provider's specific client application or a Web browser interface. Files and data can be automatically saved to the cloud backup service on a regular, scheduled basis, or the information can be automatically backed up anytime changes are made (also known as a "cloud sync"). 

cloud_computing
Cloud computing is defined as a type of computing that relies on sharing computing resources rather than having local servers or personal devices to handle applications. Cloud computing is comparable to grid computing, a type of computing where unused processing cycles of all computers in a network are harnesses to solve problems too intensive for any stand-alone machine.
In cloud computing, the word cloud (also phrased as "the cloud") is used as a metaphor for "the Internet," so the phrase cloud computing means "a type of Internet-based computing," where different services — such as servers, storage and applications — are delivered to an organization's computers and devices through the Internet.
How Cloud Computing Works
The goal of cloud computing is to apply traditional supercomputing, or high-performance computing power, normally used by military and research facilities, to perform tens of trillions of computations per second, in consumer-oriented applications such as financial portfolios, to deliver personalized information, to provide data storage or to power large, immersive online computer games.
To do this, cloud computing uses networks of large groups of servers typically running low-cost consumer PC technology with specialized connections to spread data-processing chores across them. This shared IT infrastructure contains large pools of systems that are linked together. Often, virtualization techniques are used to maximize the power of cloud computing.

cloud_computing_accounting_software
Cloud computing accounting software is accounting software that is hosted on remote servers. It provides accounting capabilities to businesses in a fashion similar to the SaaS (Software as a Service) business model. Data is sent into "the cloud," where it is processed and returned to the user. All application functions are performed off-site, not on the user's desktop.
In cloud computing, users access software applications remotely through the Internet or other network via a cloud application service provider. Using cloud computing accounting software frees the business from having to install and maintain software on individual desktop computers. It also allows employees in remote or branch offices to access the same data and the same version of the software.
Most  application providers typically charge based on usage – compared to site license fees associated with traditional accounting software deployments. Accounting data backup and disaster recovery  is often a part of your cloud computing accounting software account.

cloud_computing_reseller
A company that purchases hosting services from a cloud server hosting or cloud computing provider and then re-sells them to its own customers. Value-added resellers (VARs) can add cloud computing reseller programs to their portfolio of services and provide additional support and functionality when selling these services under their own brand name in order to generate a profit.

crm_cloud
Cloud CRM (or CRM cloud) means any customer relationship management (CRM) technology where the CRM software, CRM tools and the organization's customer data resides in the cloud and is delivered to end-users via the Internet (see "cloud computing").
Cloud CRM typically offers access to the application via Web-based tools (or Web browser) logins where the CRM system administrator has previously defined access levels across the organization. Employees can log in to the CRM system, simultaneously, from any Internet-enabled computer or device. Often, cloud CRM provide users with mobile apps to make it easier to use the CRM on smartphones and tablets.

cloud_database
A database accessible to clients from the cloud and delivered to users on demand via the Internet from a cloud database provider's servers. Also referred to as Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS), cloud databases can use cloud computing to achieve optimized scaling, high availability, multi-tenancy and effective resource allocation.
While a cloud database can be a traditional database such as a MySQL or SQL Server database that has been adopted for cloud use, a native cloud database such as Xeround's MySQL Cloud database tends to better equipped to optimally use cloud resources and to guarantee scalability as well as availability and stability.
Cloud databases can offer significant advantages over their traditional counterparts, including increased accessibility, automatic failover and fast automated recovery from failures, automated on-the-go scaling, minimal investment and maintenance of in-house hardware, and potentially better performance.  At the same time, cloud databases have their share of potential drawbacks, including security and privacy issues as well as the potential loss of or inability to access critical data in the event of a disaster or bankruptcy of the cloud database service provider.

cloud_enablement
The process of making available one or more of the following services and infrastructures to create a public cloud computing environment:

cloud provider: A service provider who offers customers storage or software solutions available via a public network, usually the Internet.
client: The customer who uses the cloud
application: the application that runs the cloud infrastructure


cloud_host
A cloud host is a server that provides hosting services, frequently Web hosting, to customers via multiple connected servers that comprise a cloud.  Whereas standalone servers and virtual servers typically present customers with limited scalability options and the potential for service disruption, a cloud host can provide customers with seamless scalability, increased accessibility, superior reliability and potential cost savings.
See also Webopedia's Cloud Computing Dictionary Resource and Cloud Computing Security Challenges.

cloud_hosting
Hosting services that are provided to customers via multiple connected servers that comprise a cloud, as opposed to being provided by a single server or virtual server.  While security and lack of full control of data are the most frequently cited concerns with cloud hosting, there are numerous benefits possible with cloud hosting, including increased reliability and accessibility, seamless scalability and cost efficiency.  Cloud hosting is also sometimes referred to as server on-demand hosting, cloud server hosting or cluster server hosting.
See also Webopedia's Cloud Computing Dictionary Resource and Cloud Computing Security Challenges.

cloud_management
Cloud management means the software and technologies designed for operating and monitoring applications, data and services residing in the cloud. Cloud management tools help ensure cloud computing-based resources are working optimally and properly interacting with users and other services. 
Cloud Management Strategies
Cloud management strategies typically involve numerous tasks including performance monitoring (response times, latency, up-time, etc.), security and compliance auditing and management, and initiating and overseeing disaster recovery and contingency plans.
With cloud computing growing more complex and a wide variety of private, hybrid, and public cloud-based systems and infrastructure already in use, a company’s collection of cloud management tools needs to be just as flexible and scalable as its cloud computing strategy.

cloud_migration
The process of transitioning all or part of a company’s data, applications and services from on-site premises behind the firewall to the cloud, where the information can be provided over the Internet on an on-demand basis. 
While a cloud migration can present numerous challenges and raise security concerns, cloud computing can also enable a company to potentially reduce capital expenditures and operating costs while also benefiting from the dynamic scaling, high availability, multi-tenancy and effective resource allocation advantages cloud-based computing offers.

cloud_provider
A service provider that offers customers storage or software services available via a private (private cloud) or public network (cloud). Usually, it means the storage and software is available for access via the Internet. See also online storage. 

cloud_provisioning
The phrase cloud provisioning refers to the deployment of a company's cloud computing strategy, which typically involves selecting which applications and services will reside in the public cloud and which will remain on site behind the firewall or in the private cloud. Cloud provisioning also entails developing the processes for interfacing with the cloud’s applications and services as well as auditing and monitoring who accesses and utilizes the resources.
The most common reference to cloud provisioning is when a company seeks to transition some or all of its existing applications to the cloud without having to significantly re-architect or re-engineer the applications.
See also Webopedia’s Cloud Computing Dictionary Resource and Cloud Computing Security Challenges. 

cloud_server_hosting
Cloud server hosting is a type of hosting in which hosting services are made available to customers on demand via the Internet.  Rather than being provided by a single server or virtual server, cloud server hosting services are provided by multiple connected servers that comprise a cloud. Cloud server hosting is also sometimes referred to as cluster server hosting or server on-demand hosting.
Cloud server hosting offers the advantages of increased accessibility and reliability, seamless scalability and potential cost savings, as customers are freed from having to invest in on-premises servers and hardware, and they pay only for the resources they consume.  On the other hand, security and lack of access and full control are potential concerns with cloud server hosting.
See also Webopedia’s Cloud Computing Dictionary Resource and Cloud Computing Security Challenges.

cloud_services
Cloud services means services made available to users on demand via the Internet from a cloud computing provider's servers as opposed to being provided from a company's own on-premises servers. Cloud services are designed to provide easy, scalable access to applications, resources and services, and are fully managed by a cloud services provider.
A cloud service can dynamically scale to meet the needs of its users, and because the service provider supplies the hardware and software necessary for the service, there’s no need for a company to provision or deploy its own resources or allocate IT staff to manage the service.  Examples of cloud services include online data storage and backup solutions, Web-based e-mail services, hosted office suites and document collaboration services, database processing, managed technical support services and more.

cloud_storage
Cloud storage means "the storage of data online in the cloud," wherein a company's data is stored in and accessible from multiple distributed and connected resources that comprise a cloud.
Cloud storage can provide the benefits of greater accessibility and reliability; rapid deployment; strong protection for data backup, archival and disaster recovery purposes; and lower overall storage costs as a result of not having to purchase, manage and maintain expensive hardware. However, cloud storage does have the potential for security and compliance concerns.
Types of Cloud Storage
There are four main types of cloud storage:

cloud_testing
Load and performance testing conducted on the applications and services provided via cloud computing -- particularly the capability to access these services -- in order to ensure optimal performance and scalability under a wide variety of conditions.  Cloud testing typically involves monitoring and reporting on real-world user traffic conditions as well as load balance and stress testing for a range of simulated usage conditions.  
Cloud testing services from companies like SOASTA, Trigent and IBM can conduct a complete analysis of a company’s cloud computing strategy and provide the results to the company in the form of interactive real-time dashboards that detail conditions under both existing and simulated peak usage.

cloud_based
A term that refers to applications, services or resources made available to users on demand via the Internet from a cloud computing provider’s servers.   Companies typically utilize cloud-based computing as a way to increase capacity, enhance functionality or add additional services on demand without having to commit to potentially expensive infrastructure costs or increase / train existing in-house support staff.

cloud-native-app
Cloud-native app is a term promoted by VMware to refer to apps that are installed in cloud-based virtual machines. According to VMware, cloud-native apps differ from traditional applications in several keys areas, including:


Cloud-native apps use an elastic infrastructure
Cloud-native apps need to provision instances of themselves through an API
Cloud-native apps must be able to scale up and down at a rapid rate, with the ability to offer thousands or even hundreds of thousands of nodes or instances
Cloud-native apps are autonomic in nature, with the ability to detect and work around failures, and if one or more nodes are lost, new nodes are spun up extremely quickly

Project Lightwave and Project Photon for Cloud-Native Apps
In April 2015 VMware announced two new enterprise projects focused on securely working with cloud-native apps, Project Lightwave and Project Photon. Project Lightwave is an open-source solution that delivers identity and access management services for providing enterprise-level security for cloud-native apps.

CloudBurst can also refer to IBM’s WebSphere CloudBurst Appliance, a hardware appliance designed to speed application creation and deployment to cloud and virtualization environments.  The CloudBurst appliance provides access to IBM middleware virtual images and patterns to facilitate cloud deployment, and can be securely deployed and managed in a private cloud. IBM recently rebranded the CloudBurst Appliance as IBM Workload Deployer.   

cloudstack
Apache CloudStack is an open source cloud computing and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platform developed to help make creating, deploying and managing cloud services easier by providing a complete “stack” of features and components for cloud environments. CloudStack competes with open source rivals like OpenStack and Eucalyptus in the cloud computing market.
CloudStack can be used to deploy public, private and hybrid cloud solutions, and it relies on hypervisors like VMware vSphere, KVM, XenServer and Oracle VM for setting up virtual machines. CloudStack provides its own API as well as support for AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and S3 APIs, and Cloudbridge technology in CloudStack 4.0 introduces AWS compatibility directly into CloudStack.
CloudStack originated as a Cloud.com project but was acquired by Citrix in 2011. In 2012 Citrix donated CloudStack to the Apache Software Foundation.

cloudware
Short for Platform as a Service, PaaS is defined as a computing platform being delivered as a service. Here the platform is outsourced  in place of a company or data center purchasing and managing their own hardware and software layers. Typically, PaaS facilitates deployment of applications, application development, testing, and also supports the building, testing and hosting of Web applications. PaaS enables IT to develop, test, deploy, host, and also update from a single streamlined environment. May also be referred to as cloudware. Sun Microsystems identifies Platform as a Service (PaaS)as one of three layers of cloud computing, in addition to Software as a Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

CLR
Short for Common Language Runtime, a runtime environment that manages the execution of .NET program code and provides services such as memory and exception management, debugging and profiling, and security. The CLR is a major component of the .NET framework.  CLR also is known as the Virtual Execution System (VES).

CLSID
Abbreviation for class identifier, it identifies a COM object. The CLSID structure wraps the COM class identifier structure, which serves as a unique identifier for a specific COM class.

cluster
A group of disk sectors. The operating system assigns a unique number to each cluster and then keeps track of files according to which clusters they use. Occasionally, the operating system marks a cluster as being used even though it is not assigned to any file. This is called a lost cluster. You can free up disk space by reassigning lost clusters, but you should first make sure that the clusters do not, in fact, contain valuable data. In DOS and Windows, you can find lost clusters with the ScanDisk utility.  DOS and Windows keep track of clusters with the File Allocation Table (FAT). The size of each cluster depends on the disk's partition size.  Also see clustering.

cluster_virus
A type of computer virus that associates itself with the execution of programs by modifying directory table entries to ensure the virus itself will start when any program on the computer system is started.  If infected with a cluster virus it will appear as if every program on the computer system is infected; however, a cluster virus is only in one place on the system.

clustering
Connecting two or more computers together in such a way that they behave like a single computer. Clustering is used for parallel processing, load balancing and fault tolerance.
Clustering is a popular strategy for implementing parallel processing applications because it enables companies to leverage the investment already made in PCs and workstations. In addition, it's relatively easy to add new CPUs simply by adding a new PC to the network.
Microsoft's clustering solution for Windows NT systems is called MSCS.

clutter
Clutter is a technology developed by Microsoft for its Outlook email client that helps users automatically organize their Outlook inboxes and prioritize important e-mails by moving lower priority messages to a new Clutter folder.
The Microsoft Clutter technology debuted in late 2014 for Office 365 users, and is now available on Outlook PC and mobile applications as well as the Outlook Web App.
Clutter is designed to learn from a user’s choices and actions to better determine which messages are more likely to be ignored by the user as they come in. These messages end up in the Clutter folder.

CLV
Short for constant linear velocity, a method used by most older CD-ROM players to access data. With CLV, the rotation speed of the disk changes based on how close to the center of the disk the data is. For tracks near the center, the disk rotates faster, and for data on the outside, the disk rotates slower.  The purpose of CLV is to ensure a constant data rate regardless of where on the disk the data is being accessed. Because less data can fit on the inside tracks, the disk needs to rotate faster for these areas  An alternative technology, which is becoming increasingly popular, is CAV (Constant Angular Velocity). Also see zoned CLV.

CMC
Short for computer-mediated communication. CMC refers to human communication via computers and includes many different forms of synchronous, asynchronous or real-time interaction that humans have with each other using computers as tools to exchange text, images, audio and video. CMC includes e-mail, network communication, instant messaging, text messaging, hypertext, distance learning, Internet forums, USENET newsgroups, bulletin boards, online shopping, distribution lists and videoconferencing.

CMIP
Short for Common Management Information Protocol, and pronounced see-mip, an OSI standard protocol used with the Common Management Information Services (CMIS).  CMIS defines a system of network management information services. CMIP was proposed as a replacement for the less sophisticated Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) but has not been widely adopted. CMIP provides improved security and better reporting of unusual network conditions. 

CMMS
Short for Computerized Maintenance Management Systems. A CMMS usually consists of hardware solution and a software package that allows an organization to manage the maintenance of equipment and facilities. Use of a CMMS package should improve productivity, lower overall operating costs, and store valuable information about maintenance functions in an organization.   Computerized Maintenance Management Systems are also called FAMS, short for Facilities Asset Management  Systems.

CMOS
Short for complementary metal oxide semiconductor. Pronounced see-moss, CMOS is a widely used type of semiconductor. CMOS semiconductors use both NMOS (negative polarity) and PMOS (positive polarity) circuits. Since only one of the circuit types is on at any given time, CMOS chips require less power than chips using just one type of transistor. This makes them particularly attractive for use in battery-powered devices, such as portable computers. Personal computers also contain a small amount of battery-powered CMOS memory to hold the date, time, and system setup parameters.


CMS
(1) Short for content management system.  (2) Short for color management system.

CMTS
Short for cable modem termination system, a system of devices located in the cable head-end that allows cable television operators to offer high-speed Internet access to home computers. The CMTS sends and receives digital cable modem signals on a cable network, receiving signals sent upstream from a user's cable modem, converting the signals into IP packets and routing the signals to an Internet Service Provide for connection to the Internet. The CMTS also can send signals downstream to the user's cable modem. Cable modems cannot communicate directly with each other; they must communicate by channeling their signals through the CMTS.  The CMTS provides many of the same functions provided by the DSLAM in a DSL system.

CMYK
Short for Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black, and pronounced as separate letters. CMYK is a color model in which all colors are described as a mixture of these four process colors. CMYK is the standard color model used in offset printing for full-color documents. Because such printing uses inks of these four basic colors, it is often called four-colorprinting.
In contrast, display devices generally use a different color model called RGB, which stands for Red-Green-Blue. One of the most difficult aspects of desktop publishing in color is color matching -- properly converting the RGB colors into CMYK colors so that what gets printed looks the same as what appears on the monitor.
Also see The Science of Color in the Did You Know . . . ?section of Webopedia.

CNA
Short for Converged Network Adapter, CNA is a technology that supports data networking (TCP/IP) and storage networking (Fibre Channel) traffic on a single I/O adapter. CNAs support both Enhanced Ethernet and Fiber Channel over Ethernet (FCoE).

CNAME
(sē-nām) Short for canonical name, also referred to as a CNAME record, a record in a DNS database that indicates the true, or canonical, host name of a computer that its aliases are associated with. A computer hosting a Web site must have an IP address in order to be connected to the World Wide Web. The DNS resolves the computer��s domain name to its IP address, but sometimes more than one domain name resolves to the same IP address, and this is where the CNAME is useful. A machine can have an unlimited number of CNAME aliases, but a separate CNAME record must be in the database for each alias.
Usage Note: While CNAME is short for canonical name, use of the abbreviated term implies that one is referring to the canonical name record, not simply the canonical name.

CNP
Short for card-not-present, a term used to describe a merchant situation where the consumer makes a credit card transaction without providing the merchant with the card directly. Card-not-present situations include mail-order, telephone, or Internet transactions.

CNR
Acronym for Communication and Networking Riser. Developed by Intel, CNR is a riser card for ATX family motherboards that was developed in order to reduce the cost to OEMs of implementing LAN, home networking, audio and modem subsystems widely used in modern connected PCs. The CNR Specification is an open industry specification that defines a scalable motherboard riser card and interface that support the audio, modem, and network interfaces of core logic chipsets. The specification is supported by OEMs, Microsoft and silicon suppliers. The specification defines the CNR architecture for both standard and low-profile risers and includes electrical, mechanical, and thermal requirements of the riser interface. In addition to supporting current technologies such as Ethernet and analog modems, the specification can be expanded for developing technologies, such as DSL. 

CO
Short for central office. In telephony, a CO is a telecommunications office centralized in a specific locality to handle the telephone service for that locality. Telephone lines are connected to the CO on a local loop. The CO switches calls between local service and long-distance service. ISDN and DSL signals also channel through the CO.

co_branding
A type of affiliate marketing where the affiliate uses their own branding to send visitors through affiliate links. For example, an affiliate may set up their own branded Web store. However, when visitors click a product link, the link is an affiliate link to purchase the product from the online advertiser. See "How Affiliate Marketing Works" in the Did You Know... section of Webopedia. Also see Refer-It.com, a directory of referral & affiliate programs for e-commerce, featuring information on over 6,500 affiliate programs. 

co_located_server
See co-location.

co_location
A server, usually a Web server, that is located at a dedicated facility designed with resources which include a secured cage or cabinet, regulated power, dedicated Internet connection, security and support.   These co-location facilities offer the customer a secure place to physically house their hardware and equipment as opposed to locating it in their offices or warehouse where the potential for fire, theft or vandalism is much greater.   Most co-location facilities offer high-security, including cameras, fire detection and extinguishing devices, multiple connection feeds, filtered power, backup power generators and other items to ensure high-availability which is mandatory for all Web-based, virtual businesses.   Co-location sites are being erected at various points around the world to provide services to the rapidly expanding Web hosting and e-commerce marketplace. The term co-location is also known as colo. 

co_marketing
A partnership between two or more companies where both companies jointly market each other's products. For example, a company who manufacturers video cards may partner with a game software company, and both companies will market each other's related product.

co_registration
In e-mail terminology, co-registration refers to arrangements between companies to collect user information. Usually this would be a separate check-box on a Web signup form where the user can opt-in to receive messages from a third party. For example, a magazine running a contest may include a checkbox for registrants to accept e-mail future announcements from them, and also from the prize sponsor of the contest. Co-registration usually adds the subscriber, provided they check the boxes to give permission, to two or more opt-in mailing lists.
See "How Affiliate Marketing Works" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. Also see Refer-It.com, a directory of referral & affiliate programs for e-commerce, featuring information on over 6,500 affiliate programs.
 

co_twitterer
A slang term used to describe a second person who tweets on a single Twitter account. See also "Twitter Dictionary: A guide to help you understand Twitter chatter and slang" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

COAST
Short for Cache on a Stick, a cache technology developed by Intel. COAST is a small circuit board with cache SRAM chips that is attached to a motherboard, increasing the computer's L2 cache. The circuit board is inserted into a special socket on the motherboard called a CELP.

coaster
The term coaster is often to used to describe an optical disk that was ruined while trying to burn, or write to it (often caused by buffer underruns). However, it's also used to refer to any  malfunctioning, unwanted or defective optical disk (CD or DVD media). The phrase is one which really caught on, and today you can find a plethora of CD and DVD burning guides which offer "coaster-free burning tips", designed to help consumers create a working disk on the first try. Adding to the terms popularity are Web sites that provide tips and tricks on "decorating and customizing" your CD coasters.

coaxial_cable
A type of wire that consists of a center wire surrounded by insulation and then a grounded shield of braided wire. The shield minimizes electrical and radio frequency interference.
Coaxial cabling is the primary type of cabling used by the cable television industry and is also widely used for computer  networks, such as Ethernet. Although more expensive than standard telephone wire, it is much less susceptible to interference and can carry much more data.

COBOL
Acronym for common business oriented language. Developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s, COBOL is the second-oldest high-level programming language (FORTRAN is the oldest). It is particularly popular for business applications that run on large computers.
COBOL is a wordy language; programs written in COBOL tend to be much longer than the same programs written in other languages. This can be annoying when you program in COBOL, but the wordiness makes it easy to understand programs because everything is spelled out. Although disparaged by many programmers for being outdated, COBOL is still the most widely used programming language in the world.


cobot

HTML clipboard
&lt;!--
.style1 {
	color: #FF0000;
}
--&gt;
A  slang term used to describe any robot that has been designed to work in  collaboration with a human, as a co-worker would. The phrase cobot is short for  collaborative robot. Cobots were invented by professors at the Laboratory for  Intelligent Mechanical Systems (LIMS) at Northwestern University, in conjunction  with automotive manufacturers.

cobweb_Site
Slang term used to describe an Internet Web page that hasn't been updated in a long time.

COCOMO
Short for Constructive Cost Model, a method for evaluating and/or estimating the cost of softwaredevelopment. There are three levels in the COCOMO hierarchy:

Basic COCOMO: computes software development effort and cost as a function of program size expressed in estimated DSIs. There are three modes within Basic COCOMO:

Organic Mode: Development projects typically are uncomplicated and involve small experienced teams. The planned software is not considered innovative and requires a relatively small amount of DSIs (typically under 50,000).
Semidetached Mode: Development projects typically are more complicated than in Organic Mode and involve teams of people with mixed levels of experience. The software requires no more than 300,000 DSIs. The project has characteristics of both projects for Organic Mode and projects for Embedded Mode.
Embedded Mode: Development projects must fit into a rigid set of requirements because the software is to be embedded in a strongly joined complex of hardware, software, regulations and operating procedures.


Intermediate COCOMO: an extension of the Basic model that computes software development effort by adding a set of "cost drivers," that will determine the effort and duration of the project, such as assessments of personnel and hardware.
Detailed COCOMO: an extension of the Intermediate model that adds effort multipliers for each phase of the project to determine the cost driver��s impact on each step.

COCOMO was developed by Barry Boehm in his 1981 book, Software Engineering Economics.

CODASYL
Short for Conference on Data Systems Languages, and pronounced code-a-sill, an organization founded in 1957 by the U.S. Department of Defense. Its mission was to develop computer programming languages.  CODASYL was responsible for developing COBOL. The organization is no longer extant, but the term CODASYL is still used sometimes to refer to COBOL. 

Codds_Rules
Also called Codd's Law, a set of 13 rules used to determine if a DBMS can be considered a relational DBMS (RDBMS). In 1985, Dr. E. F. Codd first published this list of rules that became a standard way of evaluating a relational system. The rules have since been expanded by others, and after publishing the original article Codd stated that there are no systems that will satisfy every rule. Following are Codd's original 13 rules:


Often referred to as rule 0, this rule states that all subsequent rules are based on the notion that in order for a database to be considered relational, it must use its relational facilities exclusively to manage the database.
1. The Information rule: All information in an RDBMS is represented logically in just one way - by values in tables.
2. The Guaranteed Access rule: Each item of data in an RDBMS is guaranteed to be logically accessible by resorting to a combination of table name, primary key value, and column name.
3. The Systematic Treatment of Null Values rule: Null values (distinct from an empty character string or a string of blank characters and distinct from zero or any other number) are supported in a fully relational DBMS for representing missing information and inapplicable information in a systematic way, independent of the data type.
4. The Dynamic Online Catalog Based on the Relational Model rule: The database description is represented at the logical level in the same way as ordinary data, so that authorized users can apply the same relational language to its interrogation as they apply to the regular data.
5. The Comprehensive Data Sublanguage rule: A relational system may support several languages and various modes of terminal use (for example, the fill-in-blanks mode). However, there must be at least one language whose statements are expressible, per some well-defined syntax, as character strings and whose ability to support all of the following is comprehensible: data definition, view definition, data manipulation (interactive and by program), integrity constraints, and transaction boundaries (begin, commit, and rollback).
6. The View Updating rule: All views of the data which are theoretically updatable must be updatable in practice by the DBMS.
7. The High-level Insert, Update, and Delete rule: The capability of handling a base relation or a derived relation as a single operand applies not only to the retrieval of data but also to the insertion, update, and deletion of data.
8. The Physical Data Independence rule: Application programs and terminal activities remain logically unimpaired whenever any changes are made in either storage representations or access methods.
9. The Logical Data Independence rule: Application programs and terminal activities remain logically unimpaired when information preserving changes of any kind that theoretically permit unimpairment are made to the base tables.
10. The Integrity Independence rule: Integrity constraints must be definable in the RDBMS sub-language and stored in the system catalogue and not within individual application programs.
11. The Distribution Independence rule: An RDBMS has distribution independence. Distribution independence implies that users should not have to be aware of whether a database is distributed.
12. The Nonsubversion rule: If the database has any means of handling a single record at a time, that low-level language must not be able to subvert or avoid the integrity rules which are expressed in a higher-level language that handles multiple records at a time.



code
(n) (1) A set of symbols for representing something. For example, most computers use ASCII codes to represent characters.
(2) Written computer instructions. The term code is somewhat colloquial. For example, a programmer might say: "I wrote a lot of code this morning" or "There's one piece of code that doesn't work."
Code can appear in a variety of forms. The code that a programmer writes is called source code. After it has been compiled, it is called object code. Code that is ready to run is called executable code or machine code.

code_fork
See fork.

code_signing
A digital signature added to a piece of code to prove it was produced by a known entity and has not been tampered with to build consumer confidence. In the  DRM terminology, code signing is used to verify that rights-enforcing code has not been tampered with.

codec
(1) Short for compressor/decompressor, a codec is any technology for compressing and decompressing data. Codecs can be implemented in software, hardware, or a combination of both. Some popular codecs for computer video include MPEG, Indeo and Cinepak.  (2) In telecommunications, (short for coder/decoder) a device that encodes or decodes a signal. For example, telephone companies use codecs to convert binary signals transmitted on their digital networks to analog signals converted on their analog networks.  (3) The translation of a binary value into a voltage that can be transmitted over a wire. 

codename
In software and hardware terminology, a codename is a name given to a project to identify it while it is still in development. Once the project has been completed, just before it is released to the public and retail channels in its final packaged version, the developing company will release its commercial name for the product and the the codename will no longer be used.

CodePlex

Cognos software is currently used to help businesses gain a better understanding of their financial performance strengths and weaknesses as well as help set targets and effectively allocate the resources necessary to achieve those goals.

coinbit
Coinbit is a Trojan horse designed to steal users' Bitcoin wallets. Coinbit targets Windows computers by homing in on the standard file location for a Bitcoin wallet before e-mailing the wallet to an address designated by the creator of the malware. The malware 's full name is Infostealer.Coinbit, and it was first discovered in the wild in June 2011.
Bitcoin is a popular decentralized virtual currency exchanged peer to peer and earned by users through the process of mining, or contributing a computer's CPU cycles to mathematically generating new Bitcoin. Bitcoin wallets can be encrypted, which can help prevent Trojans like Coinbit from using brute force to open a wallet, especially when strong passwords are used.

CoIP
(1) Short for communications over Internet Protocol CoIP is an extension of VoIP that refers to a set of standards used to define transmission of multimedia, including text, videos and images, over the Internet. (2) Short for conferencing over Internet Protocol is used when two or more locations want to collaborate and interact using two-way video and audio transmissions simultaneously, over the Internet.  Also called collaboration over Internet Protocol.

COLD
Acronym for Computer Output to Laser Disk.The storage of data on optical disk, such as CD-ROMs. Storing large volumes of data on laser disk, as opposed to microfiche or microfilm, lets the user access and search this information on a computer, avoid the duplication and security costs of protecting physical documents or film, and more readily distribute information.  Also see Understanding CD Burner Speeds in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia.

cold_boot
The start-up of a computer from a powered-down, or off, state.
Also called a hard boot.
Contrast with warm boot, restarting a computer via the operating system.

cold_site
(kōld sīt)(n.) A disaster recovery facility that provides only the physical space for recovery operations while the organization using the space provides its own hardware and softwaresystems.


cold_standby
(cōld stand´bī) (n.) A method of redundancy in which the secondary (i.e., backup) system is only called upon when the primary system fails. The system on cold standby receives scheduled data backups, but less frequently than a warm standby. Cold standby systems are used for non-critical applications or in cases where data is changed infrequently.  Also see hot standby and warm standby.

Cold_Fusion
A product created by Allaire Corporation of Cambridge, Mass. (in 2001, Allaire merged with Macromedia) that includes a server and a development toolset designed to integrate databases and Web pages. With Cold Fusion, a user could enter a zip code on a Web page, and the server would query a database for information on the nearest movie theaters and present the results in HTML form. Cold Fusion Web pages include tags written in Cold Fusion Markup Language (CFML) that simplify integration with databases and avoid the use of more complex languages like C++ to create translating programs. See application server.  

collaborative_editing
Collaborative editing is a process of writing and editing documents or projects by more than one person. Collaborative editing software tools like Firepad and Textflow as well as services like Google Docs facilitate collaborativelyediting individual computer files by multiple users.
Business Benefits of Collaborative Editing
Collaborative editing can be performed in real-time or in non-real-time. Real-time collaborative editing (RTCE) tools enable multiple users to edit the same file simultaneously (with merging and conflict prevention and resolution for protecting edits), whereas non-real-time tools prevent two or more users from editing a file at the same time.

collaborative_filtering
Abbreviated as CF, in electronic commerce it is the method and process used to match data of one user with data for similar users, based on purchase and browsing patterns. Collaborative filtering allows merchants to provide customers with future purchase recommendations.

collapse
)To compress a view of a hierarchy so that only the roots of each branch are visible. The opposite of collapse is expand, which makes the entire branch visible.  

collapsed_backbone
A network backbone that consists of the backplane of a single switch, rather than multiple switches connected together. From the ports of the single switch, cables connect to the hubs of individual LAN segments.   Collapsed backbones are typically used for mid-sized LAN networks. The architecture is easier to manage, easier to keep secure and less costly as there are fewer networking devices.  However, a collapsed backbone architecture typically uses more cabling over longer distances and a failure in the central switch will cause the whole network to go offline.

collate
In printing terminology, collate means to print in sets when multiple copies are sent to the printer.

collateral_hacking
Collateral hacking refers to when a company's critical data is compromised as a result of a third party in possession of the company's sensitive data being hacked. Rather than directly hacking into a company, collateral hackers go through a third party in order to get to the company’s sensitive data. 
Collateral hacking frequently results in additional companies having their data compromised, as the third party firm will often have the data of numerous companies stored on the hacked server or resource. The security concern of collateral hacking has become more prevalent with the increasing popularity of companies storing sensitive data via server virtualization, in the cloud or with other third-party storage hosting services. 

collision
The situation that occurs when two or more devices attempt to send a signal along the same channel at the same time. The result of a collision is generally a garbled message. All computer networks require some sort of mechanism to either prevent collisions altogether or to recover from collisions when they do occur. 

collision_avoidance
A means of proactively detecting whether a node on an Ethernet network can transmit a signal without risk that it will collide with other traffic on the network.

collision_detection
(1) In networks, collision detection is the process by which a node determines that a collision has occurred. Collisions occur with most networks, so a protocol is required to recover from such events. Ethernet uses CSMA/CDas its collision detection and recovery system.
(2) In virtual reality environments, collision detection is a program interface that determines how close a user is to a real physical objects and will stop their movement before colliding with the object.

collision_domain
A group of Ethernet or Fast Ethernet devices in a CSMA/CD LAN that are connected by repeaters and compete for access on the network. Only one device in the collision domain may transmit at any one time, and the other devices in the domain listen to the network in order to avoid data collisions.  A collision domain is sometimes referred to as an Ethernet segment.

collocation
Collocation or co-location refers to the placement of multiple satellites near each other in orbit to use a single fixed receiving antenna to receive signals from all the satellites.

colo
A server, usually a Web server, that is located at a dedicated facility designed with resources which include a secured cage or cabinet, regulated power, dedicated Internet connection, security and support.   These co-location facilities offer the customer a secure place to physically house their hardware and equipment as opposed to locating it in their offices or warehouse where the potential for fire, theft or vandalism is much greater.   Most co-location facilities offer high-security, including cameras, fire detection and extinguishing devices, multiple connection feeds, filtered power, backup power generators and other items to ensure high-availability which is mandatory for all Web-based, virtual businesses.   Co-location sites are being erected at various points around the world to provide services to the rapidly expanding Web hosting and e-commerce marketplace. The term co-location is also known as colo. 

colocated_server
See co-location.

colophon
When used in reference to Web sites, a colophon is a description of the tools, systems and resources used to create the Web site and keep it operational. The colophon serves to acknowledge and give credit to all the resources that combined to produce the specific site. A site typically will devote a separate page to detailing its colophon.  A colophon can include but is not limited to any software and hardware that was used to create the site, the type of server that the site is running off of, the types of scripts that are running the site and the programming languages of the scripts, the operating system the site is based on, any industry standards that the site adheres to, when the site was launched and how often it is updated, the names of the administrators of the site or the editorial team that provides its content and any other acknowledgments the site��s administrators want to share with its visitors.

color_adjustment
In graphics and image-editing programs, color adjustment(s) can be used to change the overall tone of your image and also to remove unwanted colors from your image. Color adjustment changes usually affect an entire image, even if you have selected only a small portion of the image to be adjusted. If you are working with images that are 24-bit or higher you may be able to make these changes to a specific part of the image. Color adjustments can also take other colors from the image into consideration when running the algorithm. For example if you add grey to a blue water scene, the grey will be influenced by the blue. Color balance can also be used to produce interesting image effects. By adding grey and yellow, for example, you can produce a more aged or newspaper-aged look to your image. See also color balance.  One element of color adjustment that is available in many graphics programs is color balance. This function allows you to control the amount of red, green and blue in an image. Other standard color adjustments found in many graphics program allow you to adjust the brightness, contrast and gamma in the image. These options are used to correct the brightness and contrast of an image. Adjusting the brightness and contrast highlights mid-tones and shadows to bring out detail in either light or dark areas. Gamma adjusts the brightness and contrast in unison.  See also "Graphics Software Terminology" in the  Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

color_balance
See under color adjustment.

color_depth
(n.) The number of distinct colors that can be represented by a piece of hardware or software. Color depth is sometimes referred to as bit depth because it is directly related to the number of bits used for each pixel. A 24-bit video adapter, for example, has a color depth of 2 to the 24th power (about 16.7 million) colors. One would say that its color depth is 24 bits. Color depth is also referred to as bits per pixel (bpp).

color_management_system_CMS
A system for ensuring that colors remain the same regardless of the device or medium used to display the colors. This is extremely difficult because different devices use different technologies and models to produce colors. In addition, color is highly subjective. The same colors look different to different people.  

color_matching
(n.) The process of assuring that a color on one medium remains the same when converted to another medium. This is extremely difficult because different media use different color models. Color monitors, for example, use the RGB model, whereas process printing uses the CMYK model. As color desktop publishing matures, color matching is gaining more and more attention. The most recent Windows and Macintosh operating systems include a color management system (CMS) to assist in color matching.  Also see The Science of Color in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia.

color_monitor
(n.) A display monitor capable of displaying many colors. In contrast, a monochrome monitor can display only two colors -- one for the background and one for the foreground. Color monitors implement the RGB color model by using three different phosphors that appear red, green, and blue when activated. By placing the phosphors directly next to each other, and activating them with different intensities, color monitors can create an unlimited number of colors. In practice, however, the real number of colors that any monitor can display is controlled by the video adapter.  Color monitors based on CRT technology employ three different techniques to merge phosphor triplets into pixels:  Dot-trio shadow masks place a thin sheet of perforated metal in front of the screen. Since electrons can pass only through the holes in the sheet, each hole represents a single pixel. Aperture-grille CRTs place a grid of wires between the screen and the electron guns. Slot-mask CRTs uses a shadow mask but the holes are long and thin. It's sort of a cross between the dot-trio shadow mask and aperture-grill techniques.   Also see The Science of Color and Northern vs. Southern Hemishpere Monitors in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia. 

color_printer
A printer capable of printing more than one color. Most color printers are based on the CMYK color model, which prints in four basic colors: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. By printing combinations of different colors close to each other (or, in the case of thermal dye transfer printers, on top of each other), the CMYK model can simulate most other colors (except for special colors such as fluorescent yellow). This is the same technique used in process color offset printing, which is the technology used to print most color books, magazines, and other paper materials. Some lower-price printers use only three colors -- cyan, magenta, and yellow -- but these printers cannot print true black and their colors tend to be a bit faded.  Color printers use a variety of techniques to lay down the different colors:  Thermal dye transfer printers, also called dye sublimation printers, heat ribbons containing dye and then diffuse the dyes onto specially coated paper or transparencies. These printers are the most expensive and slowest, but they produce continuous-tone images that mimic actual photographs. Note that you need special paper, which is quite expensive. A new breed of thermal dye transfer printers, called snapshot printers, produce small photographic snapshots and are much less expensive than their full-size cousins. Thermal wax transfer printers use wax-based inks that are melted and then laid down on regular paper or transparencies. Unlike thermal dye transfer printers, these printers print images as dots, which means that images must be dithered first. As a result images are not quite photo-realistic, although they are very good. The big advantages of these printers over thermal dye transfer printers are that they don't require special paper and they are faster. Solid ink-jet printers , also called wax jet or phase change printers, work by melting dyed wax and then spraying it on paper. This produces bright colors on virtually any type of paper. The downside to solid ink-jet printers is that they are slow and relatively expensive. Color laser printers  laser_printer use the same principle as monochrome laser printers, but they include four toners rather than one. Although laser printers produce better quality output than ink-jet printers, they are also much more expensive. Color ink-jet printers are the least expensive color printers. They contain three or four separate nozzles, each of which sprays a different color of ink.   Color printers are sometimes divided into the following categories:  Bi-level: Each of the ink colors is either on or off for each dot. Different colors are produced by dithering. Continuous-tone: Each dot can contain a mixture of colors. Contone: Provides more shades per dot than bi-level printers, but less than continuous-tone printers.   

color_saturation
In graphics and imaging, color saturation is used to describe the intensity of color in the image. A saturated image has overly bright colors. Using a graphics editing programyou can increase saturation on under-exposed images, or vise versa.


color_separation
The act of decomposing a color graphic or photo into single-color layers. For example, to print full-color photos with an offset printing press, one must first separate the photo into the four basic ink colors: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK). Each single-color layer is then printed separately, one on top of the other, to give the impression of infinite colors.  This type of color separation, mixing three or four colors to produce an infinite variety of colors, is called process color  separation. Another type of color separation, called spot color separation, is used to separate colors that are not to be mixed. In this case, each spot color is represented by its own ink, which is specially mixed. Spot colors are effective for highlighting text but they cannot be used to reproduce full-color images.  Traditionally, process color separation has been performed photographically with different colored filters. However, many modern desktop publishing systems are now capable of producing color separations for graphics  stored electronically. This capability is essential if you want to create full-color documents on your computer and then print them using an offset printer. You don't need to perform color separation if you are printing directly to a color printer because in this case the printer itself performs the color separation internally.  Also see The Science of Color in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia.  

color_temperature
Color temperature refers to a characterization of the spectral properties of a light source and is commonly used during the production phase in the film and photography industries. Low color temperature is the warmer, more yellow to red light while high color temperature is the colder, more blue light. Daylight, for example, has a lower color temperature near dawn and a higher one during the day. The standard unit of measurement for color temperature is Kelvin (K). Some typical color values include the following;  candles or oil lamps: 1000K household light bulbs: 2500K bright sunshine on a clear day: 6000K very overcast sky: 10,000K 

color_wheel
A circle shape that is divided equally in to 12 sections, with each section displaying a different color according to its pigment value. As all colors are created from the three primary colors (red, green and blue), the primary colors are shown forming a triangle within the color wheel. The color wheel shows the relationship between the primary colors, secondary colors, and complementary colors. See "The Science of Color" in the Did You Know... section of Webopedia. See also Webopedia's  Digital Camera Quick Reference.

column
(1) On a display screen in character mode, a column is a vertical line of characters extending from the top to the bottom of the screen. The size of a text display is usually measured in rows and columns.
(2) In spreadsheets, a column is a vertical row of cells. Spreadsheet columns are usually identified by letters.
(3) In database management systems, column is another name for field.

column_address_strobe
Abbreviated as CAS, a signal, or strobe, sent by the processor to a DRAM circuit to activate a column address. DRAM stores data in a series of rows and columns, similar in theory to a spreadsheet, and each cell where a data bit is stored exists in both a row and a column. A processor uses CAS and RAS (row address strobe) signals to retrieve data from DRAM. When data is needed, the processor activates the RAS line to specify the row where the data is needed, and then activates the CAS line to specify the column. Combined, the two signals locate the data stored in DRAM.

column_graph
)A type of presentation graphic in which numerical values are illustrated with horizontal columns. Column graphs are particularly effective for showing values that are categorized by two separate characteristics, such as year and sector.  

column_header
In Excel and other spreadsheet applications, the column header is the colored row of letters used to identify each column within the sheet, or workbook. The column header row is located above the row one. See also column.

COM
(1) In DOS systems, the name of a serial communications port. DOS supports four serial ports: COM1, COM2, COM3, and COM4. However, most software uses system interrupts to access the serial ports, and there are only two IRQ lines reserved. This means that the four COM ports share the same two IRQ lines. Typically, COM1 and COM3 use IRQ4, while COM2 and COM4 use IRQ3. So in general, if you have two devices, one of which is attached to COM1 and the other to COM3, you cannot use them simultaneously.  Also see the list of IRQ numbers in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.(2) Abbreviation of Component Object Model. 

COM_file
In DOS environments, a COM file is an executable command file with a.COM filename extension. COM files can be directly executed and are usually slightly smaller than equivalent EXE files. However, COM files cannot exceed 64K, so large programs are usually stored in EXE files.   

combo_drive
A combo drive refers to optical drives that are capable of  recording and/or reading two or more types of optical media. As DVD drives were introduced, combo drives referred to those optical disk drives that combined CD media read and write capabilities with the capability to read DVD media. As the popularity of DVD media grew, the definition of what makes a drive a combo drive also changed. In CD and DVD media, the term now usually describes a DVD drive that also includes CD media read and write capabilities. Before combo drives, consumers needed to choose between a CD burner or a DVD-ROM drive.
Combo drive is also a term which can be used to describe disc players capable of playing one or more media formats. For example, a combo drive that is capable of playing both HD-DVD and Blu-ray discs would be a combo drive.

comma_delimited
(adj.) A type of data format in which each piece of data is separated by a comma. This is a popular format for transferring data from one application to another, because most database systems are able to import and export comma-delimited data.
For example, data pulled from a database and represented in comma-delimited format looks something like the following. Each column value is separated by a comma from the next column's value and each row starts a new line:
Adams, Jane, 46, female, New York Doe, John, 32, male, California Jones, Sam, 13, male, TexasSmith, Mary, 64, female, Louisiana

command
An instruction to a computer or device to perform a specific task. Commands come in different forms. They can be:

special words (keywords) that a program understands.


function keys


choices in a menu


buttons or other graphical objects on your screen

Every program that interacts with people responds to a specific set of commands. The set of commands and the syntax for entering them is called the user interface and varies from one program to another.
The DOS operating system makes a distinction between internal and external commands. Internal commands are commands, such as COPY and DIR, that can be handled by the COMMAND.COM program. External commands include the names of all other COM files, as well as EXE and BAT files.

command_buffer
A temporary storage area where commands are kept. (In DOS environments, the command buffer is called a template.) DOS and UNIX support several operations for manipulating the command buffer. For example, you can use the F3 function key in DOS to copy the template 's contents to the display screen. This is useful for repeating a command or for correcting a mistake. 

command_driven
Refers to programs and operating systems that accept commands in the form of special words or letters. In contrast, programs that allow you to choose from a list of options in a menu are said to be menu driven. Command-driven software is often more flexible than menu-driven software, but it is more difficult to learn. 

Command_key
Macintosh computers have a special command key marked by a four-leaf clover or an apple. The Command key is similar to a PC's Alt key -- you hold it down while pressing another key to execute some operation. Typically, command-key combinations are shorthands for menu choices. For example, on the desktop, pressing the Command key and O is equivalent to selecting the open option from the file menu.  The Command key is sometimes called the Apple key or Open Apple.  

command_language
The programming language through which a user communicates with the operating system or an application. For example, the DOS command language includes the commands DIR, COPY, and DEL, to name a few. The part of an operating system that responds to operating system commands is called the command processor.  With graphical user interfaces, the command language consists of operations you perform with a mouse or similar input device.   

command_line
The line on the display screen where a command is expected. Generally, the command line is the line that contains the most recently displayed command prompt .   

command_processor
The part of the operating system that receives and executes operating system commands. Every operating system has a command processor. When the command prompt is displayed, the command processor is waiting for a command. After you enter a command, the command processor analyzes the syntax to make sure the command is valid, and then either executes the command or issues an error warning. For operating systems with a graphical user interface, the command processor interprets mouse operations and executes the appropriate command.  Another term for command processor is command line interpreter.  

command_queuing_and_reordering
Another name for tagged command queuing.

command_line_scanner
On Unix-based platforms a command-line scanner is a scanning tool that disinfects viruses, worms and Trojan horses in all major file types. Also see The Difference Between a Virus, Worm and Trojan Horse in the Did You Know? section of Webopedia. 

COMMAND_COM
The DOS file that contains the DOS command processor.

Comments are not viewed by users within a browser, but rather are only visible when viewing the HTML source code. HTML comments are written as the following, where you add your own textual note between the characters; <!-- your information here -->

comment_spam
In search engine optimization (SEO) terminology it is any comment that has been posted to a blog for the purpose of generating an Inbound link to the comment author's own site or blog.See "The History of Blogging" in the  Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

commerce_server
Web software that runs some of the main functions of an online storefront such as product display, online ordering, and inventory management. The software works in conjunction with online payment systems to process payments.  See the Server Types page in the quick reference section of Webopedia for a comparison of server types.

Commerce_Services_Provider
Commerce Services Providers, or CSPs supply businesses with the tools and services they need to buy and sell products and services over the Internet and manage their online enterprises. CSPs provide service in areas such as:   hardware/software design  risk management  payments  brand recognition  distribution control  taxes  Web site development and hosting  Web site performance monitoring  fulfillment management  online marketing  building a customer base  order processing and delivery.  

commercial_software
Refers to any software that is designed for sale to serve a commercial need. Commercial software is usually proprietary software, but in some instances it may be public-domain software.

commit_charge
)(k&-mit´ chärj) (n.) In the Windows operating system, the name for the amount of physical memory (RAM) and virtual memory that is allocated to all running programs, or applications, and the operating system itself.  Windows Task Manager displays the commit charge in its Performance tab. There are three memory readings, measured in kilobytes: Total: refers to the total amount of physical and virtual memory the computer is using at that moment. Limit: refers to the combined limit of both the physical memory and the allocated virtual memory. Peak: refers to the highest total system memory usage during the session in which you are using the computer.   The commit charge will increase when applications are opened and used and decrease when applications are closed.

commodity_cluster_computing
Refers to using a large number of low-cost, low-performance commodity computers working in parallel instead of using fewer high-performance and high-cost computers.
Also see commodity hardware.

commodity_hardware
Computer hardware that is affordable and easy to obtain. Typically it is a low-performance system that is IBM PC-compatible and is capable of running Microsoft Windows, Linux, or MS-DOS without requiring any special devices or equipment.
Also see commodity cluster computing.

Common_Intermediate_Format
(n.) A video format used in videoconferencing systems that easily supports both NTSC and PAL signals. CIF is part of the ITU H.261 videoconferencing standard. It specifies a data rate of 30 frames per second (fps), with each frame containing 288 lines and 352 pixels per line.  A related standard, QCIF (Quarter CIF), transfers one fourth the amount of data and is suitable for videoconferencing systems that use telephone lines.  CIF is sometimes called Full CIF (FCIF) to distinguish it from QCIF. 

Common_Language_Infrastructure
Created by Microsoft as the foundation of its .NET technology, the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) is an ECMA standard (ECMA-335) that allows applications to be written in a variety of high-level programming languages and executed in different system environments.  Programming languages that conform to the CLI have access to the same base class library and are capable of being compiled into the same intermediate language (IL) and metadata. IL is then further compiled into native code particular to a specific architecture.  Because of this intermediate step, applications do not have to be rewritten from scratch. Their IL only needs to be further compiled into a system's native code.

Common_UNIX_Printing_System
See under CUPS.

Communication_Streaming_Architecture
A communications interface technology developed by Intel that directly connects the Memory Controller Hub (the chip that controls the memory) to the I/O controller hub (the network interface) to eliminate network traffic through the PCI bus. The interface allows for full-duplex data transmission at gigabit speeds. Also, memory read and write operations have lower latencies because data moves directly from the network interface to RAM.

communications
The transmission of data from one computer to another, or from one device to another. A communications device, therefore, is any machine that assists data transmission. For example, modems, cables, and ports are all communications devices. Communications software refers to programs that make it possible to transmit data.


communications_protocol
All communications between devices require that the devices agree on the format of the data. The set of rules defining a format is called a protocol. At the very least, a communications protocol must define the following:

rate of transmission (in baud or bps)


whether transmission is to be synchronous or asynchronous


whether data is to be transmitted in half-duplex or full-duplex mode

In addition, protocols can include sophisticated techniques for detecting and recovering from transmission errors and for encoding and decoding data.
The table lists the most commonly used protocols for communications via modems. These protocols are almost always implemented in the hardware; that is, they are built into modems.

communications_satellite
Often abbreviated as comsat, a communications satellite is a satellite that has been stationed in space for the purpose of providing telecommunications. Communications satellites are commonly used for mobile phone signals, weather tracking, or broadcasting television programs. Communications satellites are artificial satellites that relay receive signals from an earth station and then retransmits the signal to other earth stations. They commonly move in a geostationary orbit.


communications_software
Software that makes it possible to send and receive data over telephone lines through modems. 

compact_disc
Known by its abbreviation, CD, a compact disc is a polycarbonate with one or more metal layers capable of storing digital information. The most prevalent types of compact discs are those used by the music industry to store digital recordings and CD-ROMs used to store computer data. Both of these types of compact disc are read-only, which means that once the data has been recorded onto them, they can only be read, or played.  Also see Understanding CD Burner Speeds in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia. 

CompactFlash
Often referred to as a CompactFlash card, a very small removable mass storage device that relies on flash memory technology, a storage technology that does not require a battery to retain data indefinitely. CompactFlash cards can support 3.3V and 5V operation and can switch between the two, in contrast to other small-form factor flash memory cards that can only operate at one voltage. There are two types of CompactFlash cards to accommodate different capacities: Type I cards are 3.3mm thick while Type II cards are 5.5mm thick. The card was designed based on the PCMCIA PC Card standard and can fit into a PCMCIA slot with an adapter.  CompactFlash applications include PDAs, cellular phones, digital cameras and photo printers.  CompactFlash was invented by SanDisk Corporation in 1994.

companding
Formed from the words compressing and expanding. A PCM compression technique where analog signal values are rounded on a non-linear scale. The data is compressed before sent and then expanded at the receiving end using the same non-linear scale. Companding reduces the noise and crosstalk levels at the receiver.

companion_virus
A type of computer virus that compromises a feature of DOS that enables software with the same name, but different extensions, to operate with different priorities. For example you may have program.exe on your computer, and the virus may create a file called program.com. When the computer executes program.exe, the virus runs program.com before program.exe is executed. In many cases, the real program will run so users believe that the system is operating normally and aren't aware that a virus was run on the system. See  The Difference Between a Virus, Worm and Trojan Horse in the Did You Know? section of Webopedia.  Also see  Preventative Maintenance Tips for Your PC in the Did You Know? section of Webopedia. 

Compaq
One of the leading PC manufacturers. Based in Houston, Texas, Compaq Computer Corporation was founded in 1982 by Rod Canion, Bill Murto and Jim Harris. Its first product, released in 1983, was a portable computer. The following year it released a desktop PC.  Over the years, Compaq has built a reputation as manufacturer of high-quality PCs. In 1991, it shook the PC world by dropping its prices dramatically, a move that made it the world's number one PC manufacturer.  Traditionally, Compaq machines have been available only through resellers. But in 1997, Compaq launched an aggressive strategy to manufacture "built-to-order" computers. The program allows corporations to specify the configurations they want and to purchase machines directly from Compaq. This puts Compaq in direct competition with mail-order vendors such as Gateway 2000 and Dell Computer.  In 2002, Compaq merged with Hewlett Packard.

comparison
(n.) In a biometric security system, the process of measuring a biometric sample with a stored reference template.

comparison_shopping_engine
Shopping search engines that compare the prices on searched-for products at various online stores. While most comparison-shopping engines do not offer the merchandise themselves, some may earn commissions when users follow the links in the search results and make a purchase from the online vendor. See "How Affiliate Marketing Works" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. Also see Refer-It.com, a directory of referral & affiliate programs for e-commerce, featuring information on over 6,500 affiliate programs.

compatible
(n) Indicates that a product can work with or is equivalent to another, better-known product. The term is often used as a shorthand for IBM-compatible  PC , a computer that is compatible with an IBM PC. Another term for a compatible is clone.  (adj) The ability of one device or program to work with another device or program. The term compatible implies different degrees of partnership. For example, a printer and a computer are said to be compatible if they can be connected to each other. An IBM compatible  PC, on the other hand, is a computer that can run the same software as an IBM PC.  Compatibility of two devices, such as printers, usually means that they react to software commands in the same way. Some printers achieve compatibility by tricking the software into believing that the printer is a different machine. This is called emulation.  Be aware, however, that hardware compatibility does not always extend to expansion slots. For example, two compatible printers may not accept the same font cartridges. Complete hardware compatibility is denoted by the term plug compatible.  Software products are compatible if they use the same data formats. For example, many programs are compatible with dBASE. This means that the files they produce can easily be transformed into a dBASE database or that they can import dBASE files. 

compatible_cartridge
In inkjet printing, a compatible cartridge refers to an ink cartridge that is not manufactured by the original manufacturer of your printer (called an OEM cartridge), but will function and work in the same way that an OEM cartridge would. Many printer manufacturers will state that using any compatible cartridge in your printer will void the warranty. However, compatible cartridges are popular with consumers because of the lower cost to purchase, compared to an OEM cartridge.

competitive_price_intelligence
Also called price intelligence, in ecommerce terminology, competitive price intelligence refers to the use of detailed analytics to create and optimize a retailer's pricing strategy. For example, a retailer might use price intelligence tools to scan the Web for pricing data, then use competitive price intelligence software to optimize its pricing based on the accumulated pricing data in order to better compete in the market and improve sales.
Most competitive price intelligence software and platforms provide retailers with the tools required to analyze industry pricing and obtain information on current market prices, detailed analytics to help make informed business decisions about pricing and the tools to measure the effectiveness of a competitive pricing strategy.

compile
)To transform a program written in a high-level programming language from source code into object code. Programmers write programs in a form called source code. Source code must go through several steps before it becomes an executable program. The first step is to pass the source code through a compiler, which translates the high-level language instructions into object code.  The final step in producing an executable program -- after the compiler has produced object code -- is to pass the object code through a linker. The linker combines modules and gives real values to all symbolic addresses, thereby producing machine code.  

compiler
)A program that translates source code into object code. The compiler derives its name from the way it works, looking at the entire piece of source code and collecting and reorganizing the instructions. Thus, a compiler differs from an interpreter, which analyzes and executes each line of source code in succession, without looking at the entire program. The advantage of interpreters is that they can execute a program immediately. Compilers require some time before an executable program emerges. However, programs produced by compilers runmuch faster than the same programs executed by an interpreter.
Every high-level programming language (except strictly interpretive languages) comes with a compiler. In effect, the compiler is the language, because it defines which instructions are acceptable.
Because compilers translate source code into object code, which is unique for each type of computer, many compilers are available for the same language. For example, there is a FORTRAN compiler for PCs and another for Apple Macintosh computers. In addition, the compiler industry is quite competitive, so there are actually many compilers for each language on each type of computer. More than a dozen companies develop and sell Ccompilers for the PC.

compliance
In data storage terminology, the word compliance is used to refer to industry-wide government regulations and rules that cite how data is managed and the need for organizations to be in compliance with those regulations. The term encompasses data storage, data archiving, data encryption, and also data retrieval. Compliance has become a major concern for organizations and businesses, due largely in part to increasing regulatory requirements which often require organizations to invest in new technologies in order to address compliance issues.  There are more than 8,500 state and federal regulations concerning records management in the United States, as well as additional voluntary standards. *Some of the specific regulatory compliance issues organizations have to contend with are the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for all public corporations, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for corporations in the healthcare industry and SEC regulations for retention of all electronic correspondence with clients.  [* Adapted from  EnterpriseStorageForum]

component
(1) A small binary object or program that performs a specific function and is designed in such a way to easily operate with other components and applications. The term is sometimes used interchangeably with applet.  (2) A part of a device. 

Component_Object_Model
A software architecture developed by Microsoft to build component-based applications. COM objects are discrete components, each with a unique identity, which expose interfaces that allow applications and other components to access their features. COM objects are more versatile than Win32 DLLs because they are completely language-independent, have built-in interprocess communications capability, and easily fit into an object-oriented program design. COM was first released in 1993 with OLE2, largely to replace the interprocess communication mechanism DDE used by the initial release of OLE. ActiveX also is based on COM.

component_software
Sometimes called componentware, software designed to work as a component of a larger application. A good analogy is the way personal computers are built up from a collection of standard components: memory chips, CPUs, buses, keyboards, mice, disk drives, monitors, etc. Because all of the interfaces between components are standardized, it is possible to mix components from different manufacturers in a single system.
Similarly, the goal of component software is to standardize the interfaces between software components so that they too can work together seamlessly. Two standards -- OLE and OpenDoc -- are designed to help programmers develop components that can work together. Many analysts believe that component software is the natural extension of object-oriented programming and that it will become the standard programming paradigm for years to come.


component_video
A high-end video interface that supersedes both  composite video and S-Video. Component video offers better signal clarity, which results in better picture quality. Component video cables have three RCA cables: one green, one red and one blue. Component video is an analog format that carries visual data only, meaning audio cables are still required. 

compooter
 Slang term used to describe a computer system that frequently malfunctions.

composite_applications
Applications that consist of pieces of other applications. Composite applications bring this information together in one place. For example, salespeople have disparate software applications that make it possible to do their jobs: software for contacts, ERP, a file system, and so on. May also be called custom applications, portals, Web applications, Web services, or complex applications. [Adapted from Intranet Journal]
Recommended Reading: The Difference Between CRM and ERP


composite_video
(n.) A type of video signal in which all information-the red, blue, and green signals (and sometimes audio signals as well)-are mixed together. This is the type of signal used by televisions in the United States (see NTSC).  In contrast, most computers use RGB video, which consists of three separate signals for red, green, and blue. In general, RGB video produces sharper images than composite video does.   

compositing
(1) In video terminology, compositing is the merging of two video tracks in order to produce a new single image frame from the combined tracks. The term may also be used to describe the overlaying of text and titles on video clips.  (2) In graphics, compositing is the process of superimposing one image over top of another image, combined they create one new single image.

compound_document
The term compound document is used to describe an electronic document comprising of more than one type of file. For example, a text file and image file.

Comprehensive_Perl_Archive_Network
See CPAN.

compressed_sensing
An alternative theory to Nyquist's Law that indicates signals and images can be reconstructed from fewer measurements than what is usually considered necessary. In contrast, Nyquist's Law states that a signal must be sampled at least twice its highest analog frequency in order to extract all of the information. Also called compressive sampling.

CompTIA
The Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) is the association representing the international technology community. Its goal is to provide a unified voice, global advocacy and leadership, and to advance industry growth through standards, professional competence, education and business solutions. In order to most efficiently serve the industry and its members, CompTIA has developed specialized initiatives and programs dedicated to major areas within the IT industry. They include, convergence technology, e-commerce, IT training, software services, certification, public policy and workforce development.

comptia_security

MCSA – Microsoft Certified Syste
The CompTia Security+ certification is an internationally recognized industry credential. Security+ certifies that information security professionals are knowledgeable and experienced in information security (at least 2 years). Training and preparation for the Security+ certification can be completed online or at training centers around the world.
See also "Computer Certifications" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

compulsory_license
Also referred to as a statutory license. According to U.S. law, a license to use content under reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, defined by act of Congress. For example, radio broadcasters need a license to play music published through ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC. They don't need to obtain permission from the copyright holders to play a song but must pay usage fees to the copyright holders based on how often a particular song is played.

CompuServe
Short for CompuServe Information Service, one of the first and largest online services. CompuServe supports a wide array of forums and provides many types of electronic-mail services. In addition, it is connected to hundreds of different database systems. In 1997, the content portion of CompuServe was acquired by America Online and the network service was acquired by WorldCom. 

computational_linguistics
Another name for Natural Language Processing.

computational-thinking
Computational thinking (CT) is a study of the problem-solving skills and tactics involved in writing or debugging software programs and applications.
Computational thinking is closely related to computer science, although it focuses primarily on the big-picture process of abstract thinking used in developing computational programs rather than on the study of specific programming languages. As a result, it often serves as an introduction to more in-depth computer science courses.

WEBOPEDIA QUICK FACT
Seymour Papert, credited with being the first to use the term computational thinking, is a mathematician and co-founder of the Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT. The first children's toys with built-in computation were created in his own laboratory in the sixties.


The Six Principles of Computational Thinking
While approaches to the study of computational thinking vary, there are six primary principles of computational thinking, which include:

compute
A term that refers to applications and workloads that require a great deal of computation, necessitating sufficient resources to handle these computation demands in an efficient manner.
Compute-intensive applications stand in contrast to data-intensive applications, which typically handle large volumes of data and as a result place a greater demand on input/output and data manipulation tasks.


computer
Computer generally means a programmable machine. The two principal characteristics of a computer are: it responds to a specific set of instructions in a well-defined manner and it can execute a prerecorded list of instructions (a program).

Modern Computers Defined
Modern computers are electronic and digital. The actual machinery — wires, transistors, and circuits — is called hardware; the instructions and data are called software.

computer_animation
Is a subset of both computer graphics and animation technologies. It is the creation of moving images (animation) using computer technology. Computer animation is broken down into two categories. Computer-generated animation where the animation is designed solely on the computer system using animation and 3D graphics software, and computer-assisted animation where traditional animations are computerized.


computer_business
A broad term for a commercial entity involved in the computer industry.  Examples of computer businesses include hardware and software manufacturers and retailers, software developers, PC repair and service companies, computer training firms, computer networking businesses, computer consultants and more.
 

computer_cabinet
Computer cabinets are fitted with doors and side panels (which may or may not be removable). Cabinets enclose a rack, which is a frame that provides a means for mounting electronic equipment. Cabinets come in a variety of styles, colors, and many contain baffles, fans, and other features. 
The terms rack and cabinet are often used interchangeably, which is incorrect. The rack refers specifically to the frame that provides a means for mounting electronic equipment, while a cabinet is fitted with doors and side panels.
See also computer rack.

computer_imaging
A field of computer science covering digital images - images that can be stored on a computer, particularly bit-mapped images. Computer imaging is a wide field that includes digital photography, scanning, and composition and manipulation of bit-mapped graphics.
Computer imaging is often called digital imaging.


computer_literacy
The level of expertise and familiarity someone has with computers. Computer literacy generally refers to the ability to use applications rather than to program. Individuals who are very computer literate are sometimes called power users.    

computer-network-technician
A Computer Network Technician is an information technology professional engaged in various businesses to build and troubleshoot computer networks. These individuals focus on setup, repair, and troubleshooting of both hardware and software products that are incorporated in a business’s operations.

computer_ontology
In relation to computer science, ontology refers to computer-based resources that represent agreed domain semantics An ontology consists of relatively generic knowledge that can be reused by different kinds of applications or tasks. [Adapted from Data modelling versus Ontology engineering (PDF)]

computer_rack
A computer rack (commonly called a rack) is a metal frame used to hold various hardware devices such as servers, hard disk drives, modems and other electronic equipment. Some may refer to a rack as "LAN or network furniture" as resembles a shelving structure where components can be attached vertically, stacked on top of one another. A computer rack can also be called a relay rack or open rack. Generally the individual devices are screwed into the front, which has tapped metal strips with spaced holes to accommodate the height of the devices, usually 1.75 inches of space is between each hole (measured in U). While racks come in many different shapes and sizes, the standard (traditional) size rack is 19-inches wide. Racks are usually made of aluminum or stainless steel. The Electronics Industries Association (EIA) establishes standards for cabinets and racks intended for use with computers and other electronic equipment.  The terms rack and cabinet are often used interchangeably, which is incorrect. The rack refers specifically to the frame that provides a means for mounting electronic equipment, while a cabinet is fitted with doors and side panels. See also computer cabinet.

computer_repair
Computer repair companies specialize in troubleshooting, servicing and repairing a wide variety of hardware and software-related personal computer issues and computer network problems.
Issues that typically require computer repair include failed hardware components, software bugs, driver incompatibilities, spyware and malware problems, network connectivity problems, operating system upgrades, and complete computer overhauls.
When faced with the need for computer repair, options include do-it-yourself solutions, technical support help, computer repair stores such as BestBuy's GeekSquad, and remote computer repair services.

computer_science
The study of computers, including both hardware and software design. Computer science is composed of many broad disciplines, including artificial intelligence and software engineering. Most universities now offer bachelor, master, and doctorate degrees in computer science.

A  slang term used to describe a person who has spent too many hours in front  of a computer resulting in a drug-like induced state of being. Symptoms of being  computer stoned includes fatigue, headache, sore eyes, bloodshot eyes or a lack  of energy.

computer_support
Computer support companies and services specialize in troubleshooting and fixing a wide variety of primarily software-related personal computer issues and network connectivity problems as well as some hardware issues.
Also known as technical support, computer support can take the form of an on-site visit or remote help via telephone, e-mail, text or instant messaging, online chat or even remote desktop control.
Many larger companies have their own technical support departments, whereas smaller businesses and individuals typically turn to a computer support firm or the Internet when diagnosing and addressing computer-related issues.

computer_system
A complete, working computer. Computer systems will include the computer along with any software and peripheral devices that are necessary to make the computer function. Every computer system, for example, requires an operating system.
 
 

computer_system_cooling
The phrase cooling in computing generally refers to the dissipation of large amounts of heat, which is created while a computer system is running. Heat is generated inside the computer tower by various hardware such as CPU, video card or even the hard drive. The objective of cooling is to maintain an optimal operating temperature and this can be achieved through various methods including the introduction of  heat sinks and fans. Other cooling methods include liquid cooling and software cooling.

computer_systems_administrator
Computer systems administrators install, maintain, and support an organization's information technology systems. They test system components to ensure that computers, software, and network equipment function seamlessly together. Systems administrators may be in charge of the company's LAN, WAN, intranet or Internet systems. Some administrators focus on specialist roles such as network security, IT audit, or system upgrade research.
A computer science degree or online IT degree offers an entry point into a computer systems administration degree. Most administrators have a bachelor's degree, though an associate's degree can offer a baseline credential. In addition, professional IT certifications in specific technologies help administrators advance into expert administrator or analyst roles.

computer_training
Computer training refers to resources, companies and services dedicated to helping educate users on computer-related topics. Computer training professionals instruct and help users acquire proficiency in a wide array of areas, including software, hardware, database management, programming, networking and more.
Many computer training services are designed to help students acquire certification in specific areas in order to attain job placement or advancement. Computer certifications are available in a number of specialized fields from vendors like Cisco, Microsoft, Sun and Adobe.
Some examples of certification include:

computer_aided_manufacturing
See CAM.  

computer_to_plate
A type of printing prepress process in which a digital image is transmitted directly from a computer to a plate used on a press. It eliminates the need for producing film (or negatives), stripping and shooting plates. Not only does the technology reduce costs and increases productivity, proponents of CTP claim it offers better consistency and higher quality because it eliminates the risk of human error, because the file is transmitted digitally to the plate material.

computeracy
A term used to mean being literate in computer, or the ability to read and write using a computer system. The word computeracy is also used to describe having computer skills in the workforce. Computeracy is derived from the words computer and literacy.
See computer literacy.


comsat
(1) Capitalized, COMSAT is Short for Communications Satellite Corporation, the company that was created in 1962 with the passage of the Communications Satellite Act. COMSAT was established as a carrier's carrier, meaning it cannot sell satellite circuits directly to customers, but only to wholesale communications carriers for resale. In August 2000 Lockheed Martin Corp., which owned 49 percent of the satellite company, was the successful purchaser of all the remaining shares of Comsat Corp. Today COMSAT still sells satellite circuits. However, it also operate as the United States signatory to Intelsat and Inmarsat.   (2) A general term often used to refer to any communications satellite.

concatenate
To link together or join. For example, concatenating the three words in, as, and much yields the single word inasmuch. Computer manuals often refer to the process of concatenating strings, a string being any series of characters. You can also concatenate files by appending one to another.  

concatenated_SMS
An extension to the short message service (SMS) that allows messages longer than 160 alpha-numeric characters with 7-bit character encoding to be sent using a mobile phone. The longer concatenated SMS text messages are broken down and sent as multiple smaller messages. The recipient's mobile phone assembles the messages back into one long message. Concatenated SMS is also called long SMS.

concatenation
The act of linking together two or more objects.  

concentrator
A type of multiplexor that combines multiple channels onto a single transmission medium in such a way that all the individual channels can be simultaneously active. For example, ISPs use concentrators to combine their dial-up modem connections onto faster T-1 lines that connect to the Internet.  Concentrators are also used in local-area networks (LANs) to combine transmissions from a cluster of nodes. In this case, the concentrator is often called a hub  or MAU. 

ConciseXML
A programming language syntax that is a compatible variation of the XML 1.0 syntax. ConciseXML works to eliminate what the authors call verbosity and ambiguity in XML. The ConciseXML specifications are completely free and open, and parsers are strongly encouraged to be open source. The standard file extension for the ConciseXML syntax is .cxs. Any XML document is also a valid CXS document and a CXS document can be converted into XML.

concurrent_use
The phrase used to describe a type of purchase or license agreement that is based on the number of simultaneous users accessing the  software. For example a 10-user concurrent use license would allow ten users to log in and use the software at one time, but the eleventh user attempting to log in would be blocked, and unable to initiate a session until one user logs out. See "Is Software Ownership the Same as Licensing?" in Webopedia's "Did You Know...?" section.

Concurrent_Version_System
Short for Concurrent Versions System, an open-source, network-transparent program that allows developers to keep track of different development versions of source code. CVS does not maintain multiple versions of source code files but keeps a single copy and records of all of the changes that are made. When a developer wants a particular development version of a file, CVS will reconstruct that version based on its records.  Bugs can often get into code when it is modified and may not be detected until long after the modification is made. CVS can retrieve old versions of the code, allowing the developer to see precisely which change caused the bug. CVS is also useful when more than one person is working on a specific file, where it is possible for the developers to overwrite each other's changes. CVS solves this problem by having each developer work in an individual directory and then merging the work from each after the work is complete.  It is important to note that CVS is not a build system but rather a way to control disparate versions of code as it is developed over time.  CVS is also called a version control system.

conditional
Referring to an action that takes place only if a specific condition is met. Conditional expressions are one of the most important components of programming languages because they enable a program to act differently each time it is executed, depending on the input. Most programming languages use the word if for conditional expressions. For example, the conditional statement:  if x equals 1 exit  directs the program to exit if the variable x is equal to 1.  

conditional_access
Abbreviated as CA, in digital television broadcasting, conditional access is the term used to describe a system of allowing consumers access to only those services for which they have subscribed. A conditional access system using both scrambling and encryption to prevent unauthorized reception of services by those not paying for the service. 

conference
Same as forum, an area in a bulletin board or online service in which participants can meet to discuss a topic of common interest. 

conference_phone
Conference phones are used to initiate and conduct conference calls, which enable multiple callers to listen and/or talk on the same call.  In a conference call, the host participants typically run the call with a conference phone, while remote participants dial in to a number that connects them to a conference bridge that links the various telephone lines together. Conference calls are frequently used for business meetings and corporate earnings reports, and are also commonly paired with Web conferences for online presentations and sharing documents.
In addition to standard conference phones from manufacturers like Polycom that use the traditional Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), IP conference phone products that utilize  Internet telephony, or  VoIP, are available from companies such as Cisco and Avaya.
See "The Difference Between VoIP and PSTN Systems" in the  Did You Know... section of Webopedia.Also see the VoIP Meets Wi-Fi article in the  Did You Know? section of Webopedia.

Conficker
The Conficker/Downadup worm was first tracked in November 2008 (Win32/Conficker.A) and has infected thousands of business networks and millions of PCs since that time. Conficker uses advanced malware techniques to make it difficult to protect computers. Conficker primarily prevents users from installing Windows and antivirus software updates. The worm also has the capability to launch a second stage attack that downloads code that has the possibility to be devastating, such as rogue anti-virus software. In 2009, a variant of the worm Conficker.C was also commonly called the April Fools' computer worm.  See also Rogue Anti-Virus Software Explained in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia.

CONFIG_SYS
The configuration file for DOS systems. Whenever a DOS computer boots up, it reads the CONFIG.SYS file (if it exists) and executes any commands in it. The most common commands are BUFFERS= and FILES=, which enable you to specify the buffer size and the number of files that can be open simultaneously. In addition, you can enter commands that install drivers for devices.  

configuration
The way a system is set up, or the assortment of components that make up the system. Configuration can refer to either hardware or software, or the combination of both. For instance, a typical configuration for a PC consists of 32MB (megabytes) main memory, a floppy drive, a hard disk, a modem, a CD-ROM drive, a VGA monitor, and the Windows operating system.
Many software products require that the computer have a certain minimum configuration. For example, the software might require a graphics display monitor and a video adapter, a particular microprocessor, and a minimum amount of main memory.
When you install a new device or program, you sometimes need to configure it, which means to set various switches and jumpers (for hardware) and to define values of parameters (for software). For example, the device or program may need to know what type of video adapter you have and what type of printer is connected to the computer. Thanks to new technologies, such as plug-and-play, much of this configuration is performed automatically.

configuration_file
A file that contains configuration information for a particular program. When the program is executed, it consults the configuration file to see what parameters are in effect. The configuration file for DOS is called CONFIG.SYS. Older versions of the Windows operating system stores configuration information in files with a.INI extension. The two most important configuration files are WIN.INI and SYS.INI. Starting with Windows 95, most configuration information is stored in MIF files and in the Registry. 

configuration_item
In ITIL terminology, configuration items (CI) are components of an infrastructure that currently is, or soon will be under configuration management. CIs may be a single module such as a monitor or tape drive, or more complex items, such as a complete system.

configuration_management
In ITIL terminology, configuration management refers to the process of defining configuration items (CI) within a system and recording and reporting on the status of the CIs and any requests for change, then verifying the correctness of a CI.

configuration_management_database
Abbreviated as CMDB, in ITIL terminology the configuration management database is a database that contains all relevant information about each configuration item (CI) including the CI location, status, and also its interconnectivity with other configuration items. The CMDB is also used to consolidate disparate data sets and be a current and accurate source of information about data within an organizations' IT environment.

configurator
A name for a type of software tool used in e-commerce or the name used to describe only the engine of a sales configuration system. The configurator manages the part of the sales system that enables customers to choose different components and options when making a purchase, such as item color and size or in the case of computer sales the configurator can be used to upgrade system components or allow the customer to select optional upgrades. It is often used to replace the need for human customer service or live intervention during the check-out process.

configure
To set up a program or computer system for a particular application.  

congestion
A state occurring in part of a network when the message traffic is so heavy that it slows down network response time.

congestion_notification
A signaling technique used by data transmission systems in order to indicate the status of network congestion. Devices that are communicating data across a network rely on congestion notification to determine when to send or delay the transmission of data packets.  Forward congestion notification indicates to upstream data switching devices that data is being transmitted through congested channels and some of the data or packets may be discarded. Backward congestion notification indicates to downstream devices that data is going through congested channels.

connect_time
The amount of time a computer is logged in to a remote computer. Many online services charge users per connect time. Other services offer unlimited connect time for a flat monthly fee.  

connected_tv
Another term for Smart TV, connected TVs are designed to provide a more immersive experience for television viewers by delivering interactive features such as Web browsing, social networking, video-on-demand and video streaming in addition to regular television content.
Television manufacturers currently sell a wide variety of connected TVs, and users of existing non-connected TVs can add many of the connected features to their current TVs via connected TV-capable Blu-ray players and set-top boxes.  Another option is to access free and premium connected TV content over the Web on desktop PCs, tablet computers, smartphones and similar devices.

connectile_dysfunction
Slang term used to describe one's inability to obtain or maintain an Internet connection. A user who is experiencing connection drops would say or their ISP is suffering from connectile dysfunction. See "Types of Internet Connections" in Webopedia's Quick Reference section.

connection_pool
A cache of database connections maintained in the database's memory so that the connections can be reused when the database receives future requests for data.  Connection pools are used to enhance the performance of executing commands on a database. Opening and maintaining a database connection for each user, especially requests made to a dynamic database-driven Web application, is costly and wastes resources. In connection pooling, after a connection is created, it is placed in the pool and it is used over again so that a new connection does not have to be established. If all the connections are being used, a new connection is made and is added to the pool. Connection pooling also cuts down on the amount of time a user must wait to establish a connection to the database.

connection_oriented_service
One of two techniques used in data communications to transfer data at the Transport Layer (Layer 4). A Connection-oriented service requires a session connection be established before any data can be sent with a direct physical connection between the sessions. This often considered to be a more reliable network service than the alternative, connectionless service.

connectionless
Refers to network protocols in which a host can send a message without establishing a connection with the recipient. That is, the host simply puts the message onto the network with the destination address and hopes that it arrives. Examples of connectionless protocols include Ethernet, IPX, and UDP.  In contrast, connection-oriented protocols require a channel to be established between the sender and receiver before any messages are transmitted.

connectionless_service
Abbreviated as COS, connectionless service is one of two techniques used in data communications to transfer data at the  Transport Layer (Layer 4). A connectionless service does not require a session connection between sender and receiver; the sender starts sending datagrams to the destination. In contrast with a connection-oriented service, this is less reliable but faster.

connectivity
A computer buzzword that refers to a program or device's ability to link with other programs and devices. For example, a program that can import data from a wide variety of other programs and can export data in many different formats is said to have good connectivity. On the other hand, computers that have difficulty linking into a network (many laptop computers, for example) have poor connectivity.   

connector
)The part of a cable that plugs into a port or interface to connect one device to another. Most connectors are either male (containing one or more exposed pins) or female (containing holes in which the male connector can be inserted).  

console
(1) The combination of display monitor and keyboard (or other device that allows input). Another term for console is terminal. The term console usually refers to a terminal attached to a minicomputer or mainframe and used to monitor the status of the system.
(2) Another term for monitor or display screen.
(3) A bank of meters and lights indicating a computer's status, and switches that allow an operatorto control the computer in some way.

console_game
Console games are more commonly referred to as video games. They are played on a device specially made for game play called a video game console. The player interacts with the game through a controller, a hand-held device with buttons and joysticks or pads. Video and sound are received by the gamer though a television. Examples of consoles include the Microsoft Xbox, Sony Playstation, Nintendo GameCube, and Nintendo Wii.

consolidation
In storage terminology, the term consolidation is used mainly to refer to the concept of centralized storage where resources are shared among multiple applications and users.  Traditionally, organizations have deployed servers with direct-attached storage (DAS) as file servers. However, many organizations are facilitating server consolidation by deploying network-attached storage (NAS). NAS provides a single purpose device that can provide CIFS and NFS connected storage that can scale from gigabyte to petabytes.  See also The  Benefits of Tiered Storage in Webopedia's "Did You Know..." section.

constant
In programming, a constant is a value that never changes. The other type of values that programs use is variables, symbols that can represent different values throughout the course of a program.  A constant can be  a number, like 25 or 3.6   a character, like a or $   a character string, like "this is a string"   Constants are also used in spreadsheet applications to place non-changing values in cells. In contrast, a spreadsheet formula can produce a different value each time the spreadsheet is opened or changed.   

constrictor
In DRM, a constrictor is a  software component that degrades the quality of a video signal. When the signal is copied, it produces a low-grade analog copy making it useless to pirates to copy and distribute. When these signals are resampled back to high  resolution the signal will still be poorer quality than the original.

consumer_optical_fiber
Slang term used to describe plastic optical fiber.

consumerization_of_it
Consumerization of IT ("consumerization") is a phrase used to describe the cycle of information technology (IT) emerging in the consumer market, then spreading to business and government organizations, largely because employees are using the popular "consumer market" technologies and devices at home and then introducing them in the workplace.
Consumerization of IT Security Concerns
Consumerization of IT not only refers to the use of personal consumer electronics at work -- like iPhones and tablet PCs -- but also online services, including online data storage, Web-based email services ("web mail"), and social media or social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter.
Consumerization of IT is driven by employees who buy their own devices, use their own personal online service accounts, install their own applications and then connect to the corporate network with the device, often without the organization's knowledge or approval.

contact_image_sensor
(kon´takt im´ij sen´s&r) (n.) Abbreviated as CIS, a type of optical flatbed scanner that does not use the traditional CCD arrays that rely on a system of mirrors and lenses to project the scanned image onto the arrays. CIS scanners gather light from red, green and blue LEDs (which combine to provide white light) and direct the light at the original document being scanned. The light that is reflected from the original is gathered by a lens and directed at an image sensor array that rests just under the document being scanned. The sensor then records the images according to the intensity of light that hits the sensor.  A CIS scanner is more compact than a CCD scanner and can be used in smaller products than CCD scanning technologies. CIS scanners also require less power than CCD scanners and often can run off battery power or the power from a USB port. CCD scanners, however, provide higher-resolution scans.

contact_manager
An application that enables you to easily store and find contact information, such as names, addresses and telephone numbers. Sophisticated contact managers provide reporting functions and allow several people in a workgroup to access the same database of contacts. Some also provide calendar functions, which blurs the line between contact managers and personal information managers (PIMs).  

container
(1) In HTML, the container is the area enclosed by the beginning and ending tags. For example  encloses an entire document while other tags may enclose a single word, paragraph, or other elements. In HTML code, all container must have a start and stop tag to close the container. Without a stop tag the start tag will apply to the entire document. (2) In software development terminology, the word container is used to describe any component that can contain other components inside itself. Examples of containers include Java applets, frames and windows.  (3) In video terminology, container is often used to specifically describe a container format.
