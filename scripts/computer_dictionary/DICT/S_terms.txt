s_voice
A voice command technology app for select Samsung smartphones and tablets powered by Google Android that enables users to interact with their mobile devices using their voice.


S_HTTP
An extension to the HTTP protocol to support sending data securely over the World Wide Web. Not all Web browsers and servers support S-HTTP. Another technology for transmitting secure communications over the World Wide Web -- Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) -- is more prevalent. However, SSL and S-HTTP have very different designs and goals so it is possible to use the two protocols together. Whereas SSL is designed to establish a secure connection between two computers, S-HTTP is designed to send individual messages securely. Both protocols have been submitted to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for approval as a standard.  S-HTTP was developed by Enterprise Integration Technologies (EIT), which was acquired by Verifone, Inc. in 1995.  

S_VHS
Short for Super VHS (Video Home System) it is an enhancement to VHS video tape standard that offers an improved recording and picture resolution. The better picture resolution is because the two parts of the video signal, chrominance (color signal) and luminance (brightness signal), are recorded and played back separately. See S-video. See also VHS.

S_Video
Short for Super-Video, a technology for transmitting video signals over a cable by dividing the video information into two separate signals: one for color (chrominance), and the other for brightness (luminance). When sent to a television, this produces sharper images than composite video , where the video information is transmitted as a single signal over one wire. This is because televisions are designed to display separate Luminance (Y) and Chrominance (C) signals. (The terms Y/C video and S-Video are the same.)
Computer monitors, on the other hand, are designed for RGB signals. Most digital video devices, such as digital cameras and game machines, produce video in RGB format. The images look best, therefore, when output on a computer monitor. When output on a television, however, they look better in S-Video format than in composite format.
To use S-Video, the device sending the signals must support S-Video output and the device receiving the signals must have an S-Video input jack. Then you need a special S-Video cable to connect the two devices.

S_key
A security system developed by Bellecore. S/key is a one-time, challenge-response password scheme used to authenticate access to data. The purpose of S/key is to eliminate the need for the same password to be conveyed over a network each time a password is needed for access. A series of passwords are created at once, and each password is used only one time; therefore, someone obtaining the password cannot use the information because the password becomes invalid once it has been used the first time.

S_MIME
Short for Secure/MIME, a version of the MIME protocol that supports encryption of messages. S/MIME is based on RSA's public-key encryption technology. 

S_PDIF
Short for Sony/Philips Digital Interface, a standard audio file transfer format. Developed jointly by the Sony and Phillips corporations, S/PDIF allows the transfer of digital audio signals from one device to another without having to be converted first to an analog. format. Maintaining the viability of a digital signal prevents the quality of the signal from degrading when it is converted to analog.

SAA
Abbreviation of System Application Architecture, a set of architecture standards developed by IBM for program, user, and communications interfaces on various IBM platforms. The main components are:  Common Programming Interface (CPI) Common User Access (CUA) Common Communication Support (CCS)   SAA standards were first introduced in the late 1980s. Implementing these standards allows programmers to develop software that is consistent across differing platforms and operating systems. 

SaaS
(1) Short for Software as a Service, SaaS is a software delivery method that provides access to software and its functions remotely as a Web-based service. Software as a Service allows organizations to access business functionality at a cost typically less than paying for licensed applications since SaaS pricing is based on a monthly fee. Also, because the software is hosted remotely, users don't need to invest in additional hardware. Software as a Service removes the need for organizations to handle the installation, set-up and often daily upkeep and maintenance. Software as a Service may also be referred to as simply hosted applications. See related term  ASP.
(2) Short for Storage as a Service, SaaS is a term used to describe a storage model where a business or organization (the client) rents or leases storage space from a third-party provider. Data is transferred from the client to the service provider via the Internet and the client would then access their stored data using software provided by the storage provider. The software is used to perform common tasks related to storage, such as data backups and data transfers. Storage as a Service is popular with SMBs because there are usually no start-up costs (e.g., servers, hard disks, IT staff and so on) involved. Businesses pay for the service based only on the amount of storage space used. Storage as a Service may also be called hosted storage. See related term Storage Service Provider.

sabily
Sabily is a free and open source operating system based on the Ubuntu Linux distribution. One main feature that distinguishes Sabily from other Ubuntu Linux distribution is that Sabily was designed by Muslims for Muslims. The Sabily open source operating system offers Islamic software such as Islamic prayer time applications (minbar, firefox-praytimes), a Qur'an study tool (zekr) and a Web content filtering utility (webstrict) and an Islamic calendar (hijra).
In May, 2011, the Sabily team released Sabily 11.04, codename Al-Badr. Sabily was formerly Ubuntu Muslim Edition.

safe_mode
A specific way for the Windows operating system to load when there is a system-critical problem interfering with the normal operation of Windows. Safe mode allows the user to troubleshoot the operating system to determine what is not functioning properly. For example, adding new software or drivers for a hardware device to the system can cause conflicts with existing programs. Safe mode is a way to find out what the problem is.  In safe mode, the only startup programs that are loaded are the operating system and drivers for the mouse, keyboard and standard VGA display modes. Safe mode does not run the autoexec.bat or config.sys files. The main portion of the Registry is not loaded. Himem.sys, which is normally loaded as part of the config.sys script, is loaded with the /testmem:on switch, which tells the computer to test the extended memory before continuing. Windows also boots using a batch file called system.cb instead of the standard system.ini file while in safe mode.

safe_title_area
The area where titles (text) is legible on all television screens regardless of the manufacturer or technology used in manufacturing the device. If the television has been custom-adjusted by the user, the safe area may be different than the standard. The safe area represents approximately 80 percent of the screen, measured outwards from the center. Also called safe area or safe title region.

Sales_Force_Automation
Abbreviated SFA, sales force automation is a technique of using software to automate the business tasks of sales, including order processing, contact management, information sharing, inventory monitoring and control, order tracking, customer management, sales forecast analysis and employee performance evaluation.
SFA is often used interchangeably with CRM; however, CRM does not necessarily imply automation of sales tasks.

sales_target
The term used to describe the expected performance over a given time period for an individual sales representative or sales team.

Samba
An open source implementation of the SMB file sharing protocol that provides file and print services to SMB/CIFS clients. Samba allows a non-Windows server to communicate with the same networking protocol as the Windows products.
Samba was originally developed for UNIX but can now run on Linux, FreeBSD and other UNIX variants. It is freely available under the GNU General Public License.
The name Samba is a variant of SMB, the protocol from which it stems.

SAML
(Pronounced "sam-el") Short for Security Assertion Markup Language, an XML-based framework for ensuring that transmitted communications are secure. SAML defines mechanisms to exchange authentication, authorization and nonrepudiation information, allowing single signon capabilities for Web services
.

sampling
(1) Sampling is the key technique used to digitize analog information. For example, music CDs are produced by sampling live sound at frequent intervals and then digitizing each sample. The term sampling is also used to describe a similar process in digital photography.
(2) A technique used to capture continuous phenomena, whereby periodic snapshots are taken. If the sampling rate is fast enough, the human sensory organs cannot discern the gaps between each snapshot when they are played back. This is the principle behind motion pictures.


sampling_rate
Also called a sample rate. Typically expressed in samples per second, or hertz (Hz), the rate at which samples of an analog signal are taken in order to be converted into digital form. A PC��s sound card typically will sample a received analog signal, such as through a microphone, and digitize it for use by the computer. A higher sampling rate provides a better quality reproduction than a lower sampling rate.

SAN
SAN (storage area network) is a high-speed network of storage devices that also connects those storage devices with servers. It provides block-level storage that can be accessed by the applications running on any networked servers. SAN storage devices can include tape libraries and disk-based devices, like RAID hardware.
SAN Vs. DAS Performance
Organizations often choose to deploy a storage area network because it offers better flexibility, availability and performance than direct-attached storage (DAS). Because a SAN removes storage from the servers and consolidates it in a place where it can be accessed by any application, it tends to improve storage utilization. Storage utilization improvements often allow organizations to defer purchases of additional storage hardware, which saves money and requires less space in the data center.
Recommended Reading: Webopedia's direct-attached storage (DAS) definition.
Thanks to high-speed connections (usually Fibre Channel), SANs often provide better performance than DAS. Also, because SANs usually offer multiple connections to and from the data center's servers, they also improve availability. In addition, separating the storage from the servers frees up the computing resources on the servers for other tasks not related to storage.
SANs Simplify Management Tasks
SANs are particularly helpful in backup and disaster recovery settings. Within a SAN, data can be transferred from one storage device to another without interacting with a server. This speeds up the backup process and eliminates the need to use server CPU cycles for backup. Also, many SANs utilize Fibre Channel technology or other networking protocols that allow the networks to span longer distances geographically. That makes it more feasible for companies to keep their backup data in remote locations.
Utilizing a SAN can also simplify some management tasks, potentially allowing organizations to hire fewer IT workers or to free up some IT workers for other tasks. It's also possible to boot servers from a SAN, which can reduce the time and hassles involved in replacing a server.
SAN Alternatives
Before the advent of SANs, organizations generally used direct-attached storage (DAS). As the name implies, direct-attached storage is directly attached to the server, residing either on the server or in a standalone storage device that is not part of a separate storage networking environment. Many smaller organizations continue to use DAS today because it offers lower upfront costs than deploying a SAN. However, for larger companies, the benefits of a SAN often outweigh the costs.
Sometimes people confuse the term SAN with the term NAS, which stands for "network-attached storage." The key to distinguishing the two lies in the last term of each acronym: a SAN (storage area network) is an actual network, while NAS (network-attached storage) refers to a storage device, typically in an IP network. While SANs provide block-level storage for servers, a NAS device provides file-level storage for end users. For example, the mail application on your company servers might utilize a SAN to store all the messages, contacts and other data it requires; by contrast, an end user would use a NAS device to save files, such as word processing documents or spreadsheets. Operating systems see a SAN as a disk, while they see a NAS device as a file server.


SAN_fabric
The hardware that connects workstations and servers to storage devices in a SAN is referred to as a "fabric." The SAN fabric enables any-server-to-any-storage device connectivity through the use of Fibre Channel switching technology.

SAN_services
SAN services, short for Storage Area Network (SAN) services, is a technology used by businesses to obtain greater flexibility in their data storage. A Storage Area Network (SAN) provides raw storage devices across a network, and is typically sold as a service to customers who also purchase other services. SAN services may also be administered over an existing, local  fiber network, and administered through a service subscription plan.   Learn more about  SAN services on  Datamation. Learn more about  storage networking on  Enterprise Storage Forum.

sandbox
A security measure in the Java development environment. The sandbox is a set of rules that are used when creating an applet that prevents certain functions when the applet is sent as part of a Web page. When a browser requests a Web page with applets, the applets are sent automatically and can be executed as soon as the page arrives in the browser. If the applet is allowed unlimited access to memory and operating system resources, it can do harm in the hands of someone with malicious intent. The sandbox creates an environment in which there are strict limitations on what system resources the applet can request or access. Sandboxes are used when executable code comes from unknown or untrusted sources and allow the user to run untrusted code safely.  The Java sandbox relies on a three-tiered defense. If any one of these three elements fails, the security model is completely compromised and vulnerable to attack: byte code verifier -- This is one way that Java automatically checks untrusted outside code before it is allowed to run. When a Java source program is compiled, it compiles down to platform-independent Java byte code, which is verified before it can run. This helps to establish a base set of security guarantees. applet class loader -- All Java objects belong to classes, and the applet class loader determines when and how an applet can add classes to a running Java environment. The applet class loader ensures that important elements of the Java run-time environment are not replaced by code that an applet tries to install.  security manager  -- The security manager is consulted by code in the Java library whenever a dangerous operation is about to be carried out. The security manager has the option to veto the operation by generating a security exception.

sandforce
SandForce is a line of SSD (solid state disk) processors and controllers sold by the company of the same name to partners that build and sell complete SSDs. The California-based SandForce’s SSD processors feature the company’s proprietary DuraClass technology, a collection of NAND flash management features that includes DuraWrite (which reduces write amplification), RAISE (Redundant Array of Independent Silicon Elements), wear-leveling algorithms, flash media error correction control (ECC) and AES encryption.

Some of the major companies that sell SSDs using SandForce controllers include Corsair, OCZ, Patriot Memory and Unigen.

sandy_bridge
Sandy Bridge is the codename for Intel's second-generation Intel Core processor family. Sandy Bridge processors are distinguished from previous-generation Intel processors by featuring all cores – including graphics – on a single chip, being manufactured using Intel 32nm (nanometer) die shrink fabrication process technology, and featuring Intel Turbo Boost 2.0 for increased performance on an as-needed basis.
Intel Sandy Bridge processors debuted in early 2011, and the company has since released a wide spectrum of i3, i5 and i7 Sandy Bridge processors for laptop, desktop, workstation and server computers. The codename for the successor to Sandy Bridge is Ivy Bridge, which is expected to be released in 2012. Ivy Bridge will utilize a 22nm die shrink process and is expected to offer improved performance over Sandy Bridge in the range of 20 percent - 30 percent.

sans_serif
)Pronounced SAN-SERR-if. A category of typefaces that do not use serifs, small lines at the ends of characters. Popular sans serif fonts include Helvetica, Avant Garde, Arial, and Geneva. Serif fonts include Times Roman, Courier, New Century Schoolbook, and Palatino.
According to most studies, sans serif fonts are more difficult to read. For this reason, they are used most often for short text components such as headlines or captions.


SAP
(1) Short for Session Announcement Protocol, an announcement protocol used to communicate the relevant session setup information to prospective participants during multicast sessions. SAPs typically use the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP).
(2) Short for Service Advertising Protocol, a NetWare protocol used to identify the services and addresses of servers attached to the network. The responses are used to update a table in the router known as the Server Information Table.
(3) Short for Secondary Audio Program, an NTSC audio channel used for auxiliary transmission, such as foreign language broadcasting or teletext.

SAP_DB
An open source SQL-based database system for enterprises. SAP DB supports Linux, Windows, IBM-AIX, SUN-Solaris, Tru64-Unix, and HP-UX.

Sarbanes_Oxley
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was signed into law on 30 July 2002 by President Bush. The Act is designed to oversee the financial reporting landscape for finance professionals. Its purpose is to review legislative audit requirements and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures. The act covers issues such as establishing a public company accounting oversight board, auditor independence, corporate responsibility and enhanced financial disclosure. It also significantly tightens accountability standards for directors and officers, auditors, securities analysts and legal counsel. The law is named after Senator Paul Sarbanes and Representative Michael G. Oxley.

SAS
(pronounced as separate letters) Short for Serial Attached SCSI, an evolution of parallel SCSI into a point-to-point serial peripheral interface in which controllers are linked directly to disk drives. SAS is a performance improvement over traditional SCSI because SAS enables multiple devices (up to 128) of different sizes and types to be connected simultaneously with thinner and longer cables; its full-duplex signal transmission supports 3.0Gb/s. In addition, SAS drives can be hot-plugged.
In topologies with more than two connected devices, SAS calls for the use of expander devices to allow for more than one hostto connect to more than one peripheral.
SAS devices can communicate with both SATA and SCSI devices (the backplanes of SAS devices are identical to SATA devices). A key difference between SCSI and SAS devices is the addition in SAS devices of two data ports, each of which resides in a different SAS domain. This enables complete failover redundancy as if one path fails, there is still communication along a separate and independent path.

SASL
Acronym for Simple Authentication and Security Layer. Originating with RFC 2222, written by John Myers while at Netscape Communications, SASL is a method for adding authentication support to connection-based protocols. SASL takes effect when a protocol initiates a command for identifying and authenticating a user to a server. SASL also includes an option for negotiating protection of subsequent protocol interactions. With this option in effect, SASL places a security layer between the protocol and the connection. 

SATA_2
SATA II is the next set of SATA specifications after the initial SATA specification was written. SATA II specifications provide additional enhancements to SATA, delivered in increments. The first increment, called .SATA II: Extensions to SATA 1.0. was released in 2002 and focused on the immediate needs for the server and network storage segments. Additional increments of the specification will focus on enhanced cabling, fan-out and failover capabilities and next generation signaling speeds. In spring 2003, two incremental developments were announced: a SATA II Port Multiplier specification release candidate and the completion and pending adoption of the SATA II Cables and Connectors Volume 1 specification. [Source: Serial ATA.org] See also SATA.

sata_3
SATA III, or SATA Revision 3.x, is the next set of specifications following the original SATA and SATA II storage interface specifications. SATA III doubles the maximum data transfer rate for previous Serial ATA storage interface specifications from 3 to 6 Gigabits per second (6 Gb/s), enabling faster data transfer speeds between storage units, hard drives, solid state disk drives, optical drives and protocol host bus adapters (HBAs).
In an effort to resolve confusion over the specifications, the Serial ATA International Organization (SATA-IO), the organization formed to author the SATA specifications, has encouraged the use of SATA 6Gb/s or SATA Revision 3.x instead of the moniker SATA III. The confusion stems from the 3 Gb/s data transfer rate of SATA II vs. the 6 Gb/s rate of the newer specification.
The current SATA III specification, SATA Revision 3.1, adds support for mSATA (SATA for mobile computing devices), Zero-Power Optical Disk Drives (ODD), Queued Trim Command in solid state disks (SSDs), required link power management and more.

satellite_broadband
Satellite broadband offers two-way Internet access via satellites. Your computer, through a special satellite modem, broadcasts requests to a satellite dish that sits on top of your home or business. The dish then sends and receives signals from satellites that orbit some 22,000 miles above the equator. As long as your dish maintains a clear view of the southern sky (in the U.S.), you receive broadband Internet access.* Currently, satellite broadband is slower in both the uplink and downlink, when compared to a DSL Internet service, for example. See also IoS (Internet over Satellite) * [Source: Adapted from  Small Business Computing]

satellite_radio
Satellite radio, also called subscription radio (SR) or  digital radio is a satellite-based radio broadcast service. It uses direct broadcasting satellites (DBS) a type of satellite used for consumer services such as radio and television programs. A direct broadcasting satellite is similar to a fixed service satellite (FSS), but offers a higher power output requiring smaller antennas for receiving the signal.  Satellite radios are most commonly used by consumers in automobiles as it offers better sound quality and more station programming choices over traditional AM and FM radio. The two most notable satellite radio providers include Sirius and XM. The two companies merged in 2007 to create a single satellite radio network in the United States and Canada. In the United States, satellite radio providers are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission. Consumers typically pay for Satellite radio programming on a monthly subscription basis.

Sather
A non-proprietary object-oriented programming language that is distributed under the GPL/LGPL license. Sather was originally based on Eiffel, but now incorporates ideas and approaches from several languages. The language is most commonly described as one that attempts to be as efficient as C, C++, or FORTRAN, and as elegant and safe as Eiffel and supports higher order functions as well as Common Lisp, or Smalltalk.Learn more about  Open Source in Webopedia's "Did You Know...?" section.

saucy-salamander
Saucy Salamander is the Ubuntu codename for version 13.10 of the Ubuntu Linux-based operating system. Officially released in October 2013, Saucy Salamander follows the Raring Ringtail (v13.04) release and serves as a unifying update for the operating system by laying the groundwork for accelerating the optimization of Ubuntu for multiple form factors, particularly mobile use.  Saucy Salamander also features a new Mir display server, an Ubuntu replacement for the legacy X server used on Linux and Unix systems. Additional changes include the new Linux 3.11 kernel, a Smart Scopes search feature, full disk encryption as an installation option, and enhanced integration with Ubuntu One, which provides cloud-based access to app, photos and music.
What Exactly Is a Saucy Salamander?
Saucy is an adjective that means impudent or flippant, and can also be considered “cheeky,” or playfully rude or sassy. The salamander is an amphibian with a lizard-like look that has a rare ability for regenerating its lost limbs.
The Saucy Salamander release of Ubuntu Linux was followed by Trusty Tahr (Ubuntu v14.04 LTS) in April 2014.

save
To copy data from a temporary area to a more permanent storage medium. When you edit a file with a word processor, for example, the word processor copies the entire file, or portions of the file, into an area of main memory called a buffer. Any changes you make to the file are made to the copy in the buffer, not to the real file on the disk. The buffer is temporary -- as soon as you exit the program or turn off the computer, the buffer disappears. To record your modifications to the file on the disk, you must save the file. When you do this, the word processor copies the contents of the buffer back to the file on the disk, replacing the previous version of the file.  Because computers can break down at any moment, it is a good idea to save your files periodically. Otherwise, you will lose all the work you have done during an editing session. Many applications automatically save files at regular intervals, which you can specify. These intermediate saves are sometimes called snapshots.   

savegame
Savegame is a data file that is created when you save your game. Not only does this prevent you from having to redo levels or parts of your game, but some savegame files can be modified to provide your player with additional attributes and items (as a way of providing a game cheat).

SAX
Short for Simple API for XML, an event-based API that, as an alternative to DOM, allows someone to access the contents of an XML document. SAX was originally a Java-only API. The current version supports several programming language environments other then Java.  SAX was developed by the members of the XML-DEV mailing list.

Say_Where
The name of a popular voice-enabled application for the Apple iPhone device. Say Where is a free application that can be used to recognize your speech and input it as text into Web siteswhen using the Safari browser on your iPhone. The application is used to finding locations, directions and maps. For example, users can speak the name of a place, an address, or intersection and the application will show search results from a number of partners including Google Maps, MapQuest and others.
See "iPod vs. MP3 Players: What's the Diff?"in the Did You Know... section of Webopedia. 

SB_ADPCM
Short for sub-band adaptive differential pulse code modulation SB-ADPCM is a voice data algorithm for compressing 7 KHz audio into 48, 56 or 64 KB/s channels. SB-ADPCM is used in the ITU-T G.722 specification.

SBA
Short for the U.S. Small Business Administration, a government agency that helps Americans start and manage small businesses by providing loans, disaster assistance, advocacy and training.  One of the programs offered by the SBA is the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR), in which specific Federal funding is set aside for award to small businesses in partnership with nonprofit research institutions to move ideas from laboratory to marketplace, to foster high-tech economic development and to address the technological needs of the Federal Government.  The SBA was created by Congress in 1953.

SBB
Storage Bridge Bay (SBB) is a specification that defines mechanical, electrical and low-level enclosure management requirements for an enclosure controller slot that will support a variety of storage controllers from a variety of independent hardware vendors and system vendors. Any storage controller design based on the SBB specification will be able to fit, connect, and operate within any storage enclosure controller slot design based on the same specification.

SBC
A session border controller (SBC) is a piece of network equipment or a collection of functions that control real-time session traffic at the signaling, call control, and  packet layers as they cross a notional packet-to-packet network border between networks or between network segments. SBCs are critical to the deployment of VoIP networks, because they address the inability of real-time session traffic to cross network address translation (NAT) device or firewall boundaries.  [Source:  Heavy Reading - VOIP Session Border Controls]

sbc_single_board_computer
SBC is short for single-board computer.
A single-board computer (SBC) is any complete computer that is built on a single circuit board and contains functional computer components including the microprocessor, input/output (I/O) and memory. SBC computers typically provide a fanless, low-power computing solution and a low profile architecture.

SBIR
Short for the Small Business Innovation Research program, a federal program that awards research and development funds to small businesses to encourage them to explore their technological potential and innovate new technologies that will be made commercially available to the public. The program is meant to help small businesses compete with large enterprises that have more resources for research and development and subsequently stimulate the U.S. economy by encouraging the development and commercialization of new technologies.  In order to be eligible for a SBIR award, businesses must: Be American-owned and independently operated Be for-profit Employ the principal researcher of the technology being developed Have 500 or less employees The SBIR program occurs in three stages. First, federal money is awarded to the company for research into the merit of the technology. Second, additional money is awarded for the development of the technology. The third step is commercializing the new technology, which the company must fund without any federal awards.  The SBIR program is coordinated by the Small Business Administration.  Compare with STTR.

SCA
Short for Single Connector Attachment, a type of disk drive connector that includes connection pins for the power cables as well as the data wires. The current version of SCA, called SCA-2, uses 80 pins and is frequently used for high-end SCSI devices. 

SCADA
Acronym for supervisory control and data acquisition, a computer system for gathering and analyzing real time data. SCADA systems are used to monitor and control a plant or equipment in industries such as telecommunications, water and waste control, energy, oil and gas refining and transportation. A SCADA system gathers information, such as where a leak on a pipeline has occurred, transfers the information back to a central site, alerting the home station that the leak has occurred, carrying out necessary analysis and control, such as determining if the leak is critical, and displaying the information in a logical and organized fashion. SCADA systems can be relatively simple, such as one that monitors environmental conditions of a small office building, or incredibly complex, such as a system that monitors all the activity in a nuclear power plant or the activity of a municipal water system.
SCADA systems were first used in the 1960s.


scalable
(1) A popular buzzword that refers to how well a hardware or software system can adapt to increased demands. For example, a scalable network system would be one that can start with just a few nodes but can easily expand to thousands of nodes. Scalability can be a very important feature because it means that you can invest in a system with confidence you won't outgrow it.
(2)Refers to anything whose size can be changed. For example, a font is said to be scalable if it can be represented in different sizes.
(3)When used to describe a computer system, the ability to run more than one processor.

scalable_font
A font represented in an object-oriented graphics language such as PostScript or TrueType. Such fonts are called scalable because the representation of the font defines the shape of each character (the typeface) but not the size. Given a typeface definition, a scalable-font system can produce characters at any size (or scale).  Aside from offering innumerable sizes of each font, scalable fonts have an added advantage in that they make the most of an output device 's resolution. The more resolution a printer or monitor has, the better a scalable font will look.  Scalable fonts are often called outline fonts because the most common method of representing scalable fonts is to define the outline of each character. Scalable fonts are also called object-oriented  fonts or vector fonts.   

scalable_parallel_processor
Abbreviated as SPP, a computer that utilizes parallel processing that can be upgraded by adding more CPUs to it, effectively increasing its computing power.

scale
To change the size of an object while maintaining its shape. Most graphics  software, particularly vector -based packages, allow you to scale objects freely. 

scale_out_storage
A storage system that uses a scaling methodology to create a dynamic storage environment that will support balanced data growth on an as-needed basis. Scale-out storage architecture uses a number of storage nodes -- consisting of multiple low-cost computer servers and storage components -- that are configured to create a storage pool or are configured to increase computing power to exceed a traditional storage array.
Using scale-out storage, the approach is to add storage nodes that work in tandem as you require additional storage resources. The scale-out architecture is designed to scale both capacity and performance.

SCAM
Short for SCSI Configuration Automatically, a subset of the PnP specification that provides plug-and-play support for SCSI devices. 

scan
To digitize an image by passing it through an optical scanner. See under optical scanner. 

ScanDisk
A DOS and Windows utility that finds different types of errors on hard disks and is able to correct some of them. In DOS, you run ScanDisk by entering scandisk at the prompt and pressing the Enter key. In Windows 95, you can run ScanDisk by selecting Start->Programs->Accessories->System Tools->ScanDisk.  Among other things, ScanDisk checks the disk platters for defects and also looks for lost clusters that are sometimes created when a program aborts. 

scareware
A type of software that is defined as malware, meaning it is designed specifically to damage or disrupt a computer system. In this case, not only does the software disrupt your system, it's going to try and trick (or scare) you into making a purchase using your credit card. Scareware is also called smitfraud or rogue security software.See rogue antivirus software.See also "Rogue Anti-Virus Software Explained" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia. 


scatter_diagram
A type of diagram used to show the relationship between data items that have two numeric properties. One property is represented along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis. Each item is then represented by a single point.  Scatter diagrams are used frequently by computer publications to compare categories of hardware and software products. One axis represents price, while the other represents performance. Typically, all compared products fall near an imaginary diagonal line -- that is, performance and price rise together. However, the scatter diagram makes it easy to see items that do not fall near this line, items that are expensive but offer poor performance or items that are inexpensive but provide good performance.   

scattering
In fiber optic transmissions, scattering is the loss of signal caused by the diffusion of a light beam, where the diffusion itself is caused by microscopic variations in the transmission medium. Scattering typically happens when a light signal hits an impurity in the fiber.

scatternet
A group of independent and non-synchronized piconets that share at least one common Bluetooth device. Bluetooth devices must have point-to-multipoint capability to engage in scatternet communication. There may be a maximum of 10 fully loaded piconets in a scatternet.

scheduler
(1) A software product designed to help a group of colleagues schedule meetings and other appointments. The scheduler program allows members of a group to view each others' calendars so that they can choose a convenient time. Once a time has been selected, the scheduler can automatically send out reminders through e-mail and can even reserve resources such as conference rooms and overhead projectors.  (2) In operating systems, a scheduler is a program that coordinates the use of shared resources, such as a printer. 

schema
Pronounce skee-ma, the structure of a database system, described in a formal language supported by the database management system (DBMS). In a relational database, the schema defines the tables, the fields in each table, and the relationships between fields and tables.
Schemas are generally stored in a data dictionary. Although a schema is defined in text database language, the term is often used to refer to a graphical depiction of the database structure.
 

schroedinbug
In computer programming, schroedinbug is a classification of an unusual software bug. This type of bug is one that goes unnoticed until a programmer or other person reads the software code and discovers that the program never should have been able to work in the first place. In discovering the schroedinbug, the bug manifests and the program will no longer function until the bug has been fixed.  The name schroedinbug is from Schroedinger's Cat thought-experiment in quantum physics, where in 1935 Erwin Schrodinger proposed a famous thought experiment in which a cat was somehow both alive and dead at the same time.

scientific_linux
Scientific Linux (SL) is an open source Linux release developed by Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and various scientists and universities. 
The base SL distribution is Enterprise Linux, recompiled from source. Scientific Linux aims to prevent scientists at each of these different institutions from having to recreate a Linux distribution that meets their needs. Scientific Linux is similar to Red Hat Enterprise Linux, with a few slight modifications.
See "Linux Downloads: Top Linux Distributions" in Webopedia's Did You Know section.

scientific_notation
A format for representing real (floating-point) numbers. Instead of writing the full number, scientific notation represents values as a number between 1 and 10 multiplied by 10 to some power. The 10 is often replaced by an uppercase or lowercase E.  Scientific notation is much simpler for very large and very small numbers, such as the second and fourth examples. Most programming languages, and many numeric applications, allow you to enter and display numbers using scientific notation. 

SCM
Abbreviated as SCM, source code manager is a set of tools used to manage the coding source for teamwork on Windows or UNIX platforms. SCM provides a permanent and secure data repository for source components. See also source code control system.

SCMS
Short for the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992, an amendment to the U.S. federal Copyright Act of 1976. According to the AHRA, the manufacturers and importers of digital audio recording devices and media must pay a royalty tax to the copyright holders of music that is presumably being copied in order to compensate them for lost royalties due to consumers copying audio recordings at home. The payments are made to the U.S. Copyright office, which then distributes the royalties accordingly. Digital audio recording devices also must include a system that prohibits serial copying. The most common system in use is the Serial Copy Management System (SCMS), which permits first-generation digital-to-digital copies of prerecorded music but prohibits serial copies of those copies. In exchange, the copyright holders waive the right to claim copyright infringement against consumers using audio recording devices in their homes for noncommercial use. The royalty requirements do not apply to computers as they are not considered digital audio recording devices.

SCPC
Short for single channel per carrier, a VSAT satellite transmission system that uses a separate carrier for each of its channels. SCPC is used for broadcast data and full-duplex audio/video communications. In an SCPC system, transmissions are sent to the satellite continuously on a single satellite carrier. The satellite signal is received at a single location, in the case of a point-to-point system, or at many locations in a broadcast system, providing hubless connectivity among multiple sites.  Contrast SCPC with frequency division multiplexing, a technology that combines multiple channels on a single carrier.

Scrapbook
In Macintosh environments, a desk accessory (DA) that enables you to store objects for future use. The Scrapbook is similar to the clipboard, but it allows more than one item to be stored in it at once. Also, it retains its contents when the computer is turned off.   

scratch_disk
Space dedicated on a hard drive for temporary storage of data. Scratch disks are commonly used in graphic design programs, such as Adobe Photoshop. Scratch disk space is only for temporary storage and cannot be used for permanently backing up files.  Scratch disks can be set to erase all data at regular intervals so that the disk space is left free for future use. The management of scratch disk space is typically dynamic, occurring when needed.

scratch_programming_language
Scratch is a free visual programming language developed to help simplify the process of creating and programming animations, games, music, interactive stories and more.

The Scratch programming language is primarily targeted at children ages eight and older, and is designed to teach computational thinking using a simple but powerful building-block approach to software development that focuses more on problem solving than on specific syntax.

scratchpad_RAM
A portion of L1 cache reserved for direct and private usage by the CPU. Typically, a cache is used to temporarily store copies of data that resides on slower main memory. However, the CPU can use scratchpad RAM for any purpose, such as storing instructions or intermediate values. 

screedosphere
The combination of different opinions and views presented through talk radio, cable news and blogs. This term was first used in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram on February 25, 2005 in reference to politics and political discussions.

screen
The display part of a monitor. Most display screens work under the same principle as a television, using a cathode ray tube  (CRT). Consequently, the term CRT is often used in place of display screen.   

screen_capture
Refers to the act of copying what is currently displayed on a screen to a file or printer. If the system is in graphics mode, the screen capture will result in a graphics file containing a bit map of the image. If the system is in text mode, the screen capture will normally load a file with ASCII codes.

screen_flicker
The phenomenon whereby a display screen appears to flicker. Screen flicker results from a variety of factors, the most important of which is the monitor's refresh  rate, the speed with which the screen is redrawn. If the refresh rate is too slow, the screen will appear to glimmer. Another factor that affects screen flicker is the persistence of the screen phosphors. Low-persistence phosphors fade more quickly than high-persistence monitors, making screen flicker more likely. Screen flicker can also be affected by lighting. Finally, screen flicker is a subjective perception that affects people differently. Some people perceive screen flicker where others do not. 

screen_font
A font designed especially for a display screen. Typically, display fonts are bit-mapped, and must be specially designed to compensate for the relatively low resolution of display screens. 

screen_lock
Screen lock is a security feature for computers and mobile devices that helps prevent unauthorized access to the device. Also known as a screenlock or lock screen, a screen lock requires a specific action or sequence of actions to be correctly performed by anyone attempting to use a lockscreen-protected device.
Screen locks or lock screens can require the user to enter a password or passphrase, perform a specific gesture or motion on the touchscreen, or access a biometric reader that analyzes the user’s fingerprint, scans their eye or conducts a similar analysis for recognition of the user. 

screen_saver
A small program that takes over the display screen if there are no keystrokes or mouse movements for a specified duration. Screen savers were originally developed to prevent ghosting, the permanent etching of a pattern on a display screen. For older monochrome monitors, ghosting often occurred if the same pattern was displayed on a display screen for a long period of time. Screen savers would prevent this by either blanking out the screen entirely or by displaying a constantly moving image.  Modern display screens do not suffer so much from this problem. Today, therefore, screen savers are mostly an adornment, a way to liven up the computer. Many screen savers provide another benefit, hiding a user's work from would-be snoopers. These screen savers fill the display with an image or animation until the user enters a password. 

screen_scraper
Software that allows a PC to intercept character-based data from a mainframe -- often presented in a green screen -- and present it in an easier to understand graphical user interface (GUI ). Newer screen scrapers present the information in HTML, so it can be accessed with a browser. Leading makers include Mozart (www.mozart.com), Flashpoint, Inc. (www.flashpt.com) and Intelligent Environments (www.screensurfer.com).    

screenager
A slang term used to describe teenagers who spend too much time in front of the screen (television or computer screens).

ScreenTip
A graphical user interface (GUI) feature in which a small text box appears when a mouse pointer is hovered over an icon or button. The pop-up window will provide details that explain the icon's or button's function. In some instances, though, the ScreenTip will display only the item's name. When the mouse is moved away from the icon or button, the ScreenTip will disappear from view.  A ScreenTip is also called a ToolTip.

script
Another term for macro or batch file, a script is a list of commands that can be executed without user interaction. A script language  is a simple programming language with which you can write scripts.
Apple Computer uses the term script to refer to programs written in its HyperCard or AppleScriptlanguage.


script_kiddie
A person, normally someone who is not technologically sophisticated, who randomly seeks out a specific weakness over the Internet in order to gain root access to a system without really understanding what it is s/he is exploiting because the weakness was discovered by someone else. A script kiddie is not looking to target specific information or a specific company but rather uses knowledge of a vulnerability to scan the entire Internet for a victim that possesses that vulnerability. 

scripting_language
(skript´ing lang´gwij) (n.) A high-level programming language that is interpreted by another program at runtime rather than compiled by the computer's processor as other programming languages (such as C and C++) are. Scripting languages, which can be embedded within HTML, commonly are used to add functionality to a Web page, such as different menu styles or graphic displays or to serve dynamic advertisements. These types of languages are client-side scripting languages, affecting the data that the end user sees in a browser window. Other scripting languages are server-side scripting languages that manipulate the data, usually in a database, on the server.
Scripting languages came about largely because of the development of the Internet as a communications tool. JavaScript, ASP, JSP, PHP, Perl, Tcl and Python are examples of scripting languages.

scroll
)To view consecutive lines of data on the display screen. The term scroll means that once the screen is full, each new line appears at the edge of the screen and all other lines move over one position. For example, when you scroll down, each new line appears at the bottom of the screen and all the other lines move up one row, so that the top line disappears.  The term vertical scrolling refers to the ability to scroll up or down. Horizontal scrolling means that the image moves sideways.  In theory, the display should move smoothly, as if it were a piece of paper being moved up, down, or sideways. In practice, however, scrolling is not always so smooth.  The scrolling method of viewing documents does not recognize page boundaries. One advantage to scrolling, therefore, is that you can look at the end of one page and the beginning of the next page at the same time.  Another method of viewing data is called paging, whereby an entire page is displayed at once. Each subsequent page replaces the previous page on the screen.   

scroll_bar
)A bar that appears on the side or bottom of a window to control which part of a list or document is currently in the window 's frame. The scroll bar makes it easy to move to any part of a file.
Typically, a scroll bar has arrows at either end, a gray or colored area in the middle, and a scroll box (or elevator) that moves from one end to the other to reflect your position in the document. Clicking on the arrows causes the document to scroll in the indicated direction. You can also quickly move to any part of a document by dragging the scroll box to the corresponding part of the scroll bar.
Many windowing systems support both horizontal and vertical scroll bars.

Scroll_Lock_key
A key on PC and enhanced Macintosh keyboards that controls the way the cursor control keys work for some programs. Many applications ignore the Scroll Lock setting. 

SCTP
Acronym for Stream Control Transmission Protocol. SCTP is a type of mobility management for IP-based  networks that focuses on the transport and session layers, rather the network layer. SCTP, in general terms, is a reliable transport  protocol operating on top of potentially unreliable connectionless packet service such as  IP. SCTP can be used as the transport protocol for  applications where monitoring and detection of loss of session is required. For such applications, the SCTP path/session failure detection mechanisms, especially the heartbeat, will actively monitor the connectivity of the session. SCTP offers recognized error-free non-duplicated transfer of messages. Detection of  data loss, data corruption and duplication of data is achieved by using  checksums and  sequence numbers. A selective retransmission mechanism is applied to correct loss or corruption of data. SCTP connections are established after a 4-way handshake between two SCTP endpoints, usually a  client and a  server. The server, after having received the client��s association setup request, returns an acknowledgement of the setup request containing a data structure called cookie, which is protected by a secure message authentication code, and does not change state. Only when this cookie is returned by the client unchanged does the server allocate resources and establish a new association. With its inception, SCTP was designed to provide a general purpose transport protocol for message-oriented applications. It has been designed by the IETF SIGTRAN working group, which has released the SCTP standard draft document ( RFC2960 ) in October 2000. Its design includes appropriate congestion avoidance behavior and resistance to flooding and masquerade attacks.

SCTP_association
The term used in RFC2960 to describe a protocol relationship between SCTP endpoints. SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) association is composed of two SCTP endpoints and protocol state information including verification tags (a 32-bit unsigned integer that is randomly generated) and the currently active set of Transmission Sequence Numbers (TSNs). The association can be uniquely identified by the transport addresses used by the endpoints in the association.  Also see "The OSI Reference Model - Understanding Layers" in the  Did You Know...? section of Webopedia.

SCTP_endpoint
The term used in RFC2960 to describe the logical sender or receiver of SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) packets. An SCTP endpoint is represented to its peers as a combination of a set of eligible destination transport addresses to which SCTP packets can be sent and a set of eligible source transport addresses from which SCTP packets can be received. A transport address used by an SCTP endpoint is unique to an SCTP endpoint.  Also see "The OSI Reference Model - Understanding Layers"  in the  Did You Know...? section of Webopedia.

SD_Card
An SD Card (Secure Digital Card) is an ultra small flash memory card designed to provide high-capacity memory in a small size. SD cards are used in many small portable devices such as digital video camcorders, digital cameras, handheld computers, audio players and mobile phones. In use since 1999, SD Memory Cards are now available in capacities between 16 Megabytes and 1 Gigabyte. An SD card typically measures 32 x 24 x 2.1 mm and weighs approximately 2grams.

software_defined_data_center_SDDC
SDDC is short for software-defined data center.May also be called software-defined datacenter (SDD) or virtual data center.
Software-defined data center (SDDC) is the phrase used to refer to a data center where all infrastructure is virtualized and delivered as a service. Control of the data center is fully automated by software, meaning hardware configuration is maintained through intelligent software systems. This is in contrast to traditional data centers where the infrastructure is typically defined by hardware and devices.
Software-defined data centers are considered by many to be the next step in the evolution of virtualization and cloud computing as it provides a solution to support both legacy enterprise applications and new cloud computing services.
Core Components of the Software-Defined Data Center
According to Torsten Volk, EMA, there are three core components of the software-defined data center: network virtualization, server virtualization and storage virtualization. A business logic layer is also required to translate application requirements, SLAs, policies and cost considerations. (Source: EMA Blogs; The Software-Defined Data center: Core Components)


software-defined_environment
A term coined by IBM for its "software-defined everything" vision. The company's Software-Defined Environments (SDE) group is the latest evolution of what first began as the Application, Integration and Middleware group inside the IBM Software group.
According to this eWeek article, IBM says "a Software-Defined Environment (SDE) optimizes the entire computing infrastructure – compute, storage and network resources – so that it can adapt to the type of work required. In today's environment, resources are assigned manually to workloads; that happens automatically in a SDE."
By dynamically assigning workloads to IT resources based on a variety of factors, including the characteristics of specific applications, the best-available resources, and service-level policies, a software-defined environment can deliver continuous, dynamic optimization and reconfiguration to address infrastructure issues.

SDH
Short for Synchronous Digital Hierarchy, an international standard for synchronous data transmission over fiber optic cables. The North American equivalent of SDH is SONET.  SDH defines a standard rate of transmission at 155.52 Mbps, which is referred to as STS-3 at the electrical level and STM-1 for SDH. STM-1 is equivalent to SONET's Optical Carrier (OC) levels -3. 

SDHC
Short for Secure Digital High Capacity, SDHC is a type of flash memory card based on the SDA 2.00 specification. The SDA 2.00 specification enables SD cards to reach higher capacities from 4GB to 32GB, and growing. SDHC uses a new technology, and as such these cards are not backwards compatible with SD format devices. SDHC uses a defined 3 speed class system to help consumers with the different data transfer speed (DTS) and performance minimum requirements;  Class 2: minimum sustained DTS of 2MB/sec Class 4: minimum sustained DTS of 4MB/sec Class 6: minimum sustained DTS of 6MB/sec  The SD Specification Version 2.0 for the SDHC memory card was established by the SD Card Association (SDA).

SDK
Short for software development kit, a programming package that enables a programmer to develop applications for a specific platform. Typically an SDK includes one or more APIs, programming tools, and documentation.


SDLC
(1) Acronym for synchronous data link control, a communications protocol used in IBM's SNA networks. SDLC is similar to  HDLC, an ISO standard.
(2) Acronym for system development life cycle. SDLC is the process of developing information systems through investigation, analysis, design, implementation and maintenance. SDLC is also known as information systems development or application development. SDLC is a systems approach to problem solving and is made up of several phases, each comprised of multiple steps:

The software concept - identifies and defines a need for the new system
A requirements analysis - analyzes the information needs of the end users
The architectural design - creates a blueprint for the design with the necessary specifications for the  hardware, software, people and data resources
Coding and debugging - creates and programs the final system
System testing - evaluates the system's actual functionality in relation to expected or intended functionality.

(3) Acronym for software development life cycle (SDLC) and also synonymous with software process as well as software engineering, it is a structured methodology used in the development of software products and packages. This methodology is used from the conception phase through to the delivery and end of life of a final software product. See under  software engineering.

SDMA
Short for spatial division multiple access, SDMA is a satellite communications mode for using data from antenna arrays in wireless communications systems. At the base station, SDMA continually adapts to the radio environment, providing each user with uplink and downlink signals of the highest possible quality. At the network level, this improved base station performance can be exploited to increase base station range. [Adapted from 'Intelligent Antennas: Spatial Division Multiple Access']


SDMI
Short for the Secure Digital Music Initiative, a forum comprised of more than 200 IT, consumer electronics, security technology, ISP and recording industry companies with the purpose of developing technology specifications that protect the playing, storing and distributing of digital music. Specifically, the goals of the SDMI were to provide consumers with convenient access to music online and in new digital distribution systems, to enable copyright protection for the work of artists, and to promote the development of new music-related business and technologies.  The SDMI has been inactive since May 2001.

software_defined_networking
SDN is short for software defined networking.
Software defined networking (SDN) is an approach to using open protocols, such as OpenFlow, to apply globally aware software control at the edges of the network to access network switches and routers that typically would use closed and proprietary firmware.
Benefits of SDN
Software defined networking offers numerous benefits including on-demand provisioning, automated load balancing, streamlined physical infrastructure and the ability to scale network resources in lockstep with application and data needs. As noted on Enterprise Networking Planet, coupled with the ongoing virtualization of servers and storage, SDN ushers in no less than the completely virtualized data center, where end-to-end compute environments will be deployed and decommissioned on a whim.

SDP
Short for Session Description Protocol, a protocol that defines a text-based format for describing streaming media sessions and multicast transmissions. SDP is not a transport protocol but a method of describing the details of the transmission. For example, an SDP file contains information about the format, timing and authorship of the transmission, name and purpose of the session, any media, protocols or codec formats, the version number, contact information and broadcast times.  In addition to being transport protocols, RTSP and Session Initiated Protocol also rely on SDP.

SDRAM
Short for Synchronous DRAM, a type of DRAM that can run at much higher clock speeds than conventional memory. SDRAM actually synchronizes itself with the CPU's bus and is capable of running at 133 MHz, about three times faster than conventional FPM RAM, and about twice as fast EDO DRAM and BEDO DRAM. SDRAM is replacing EDO DRAM in many newer computers.
Also see the  Guide to System Memory page in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

software-defined_storage_sds
Storage infrastructure that is managed and automated by intelligent software as opposed to by the storage hardware itself. In this way, the pooled storage infrastructure resources in a software-defined storage (SDS) environment can be automatically and efficiently allocated to match the application needs of an enterprise.
Separating the Storage Hardware from the Software
By separating the storage hardware from the software that manages the storage infrastructure, software-defined storage enables enterprises to purchase heterogeneous storage hardware without having to worry as much about issues such as interoperability, under- or over-utilization of specific storage resources, and manual oversight of storage resources.
The software that enables a software-defined storage environment can provide functionality such as deduplication, replication, thin provisioning, snapshots and other backup and restore capabilities across a wide range of server hardware components. The key benefits of software-defined storage over traditional storage are increased flexibility, automated management and cost efficiency.


SDSL
Short for symmetric digital subscriber line, a technology that allows more data to be sent over existing copper telephone lines (POTS). SDSL supports data rates up to 3 Mbps.  SDSL works by sending digital pulses in the high-frequency area of telephone wires and can not operate simultaneously with voice connections over the same wires.  SDSL requires a special SDSL modem. SDSL is called symmetric because it supports the same data rates for upstream and downstream traffic. A similar technology that supports different data rates for upstream and downstream data is called asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL). ADSL is more popular in North America, whereas SDSL is being developed primarily in Europe. Also see  Cable vs. DSL in Webopedia's "Did You Know...?" section.

SDTV
Short for Standard Definition Television it is a type of digital television operation method which is able to transmit and produce images which are of a higher quality than standard analog broadcast. SDTV is typically a 480i signal - where 480 represents the vertical resolution and i represents  interlaced. Digital cable and digital satellite programming is widely available in SDTV format. While SDTV does not reach near the quality of HDTV, it is superior over traditional analog television.  * SDTV Minimum Performance Attributes:  Receiver: Receives ATSC terrestrial digital transmissions and decodes all ATSC Table 3 video formats, and produces a useable picture  Display Scanning Format: Has active vertical scanning lines less than that of EDTV  Aspect Ratio: None specified  Audio: Receives and reproduces usable audio   (* Adapted from Digital Connection)

Seagate_Technology_Company
Seagate was founded in 1979 and was the first company to build 5.25-inch hard disk drives for the PC.  At the core of Seagate's success is its advanced development of hard disc drive products. Seagate is the market leader with products in 1-inch, 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch form factors in internal and external formats.

search_and_replace
A feature supported by most word processors that lets you replace a character string (a series of characters) with another string wherever the first string appears in the document. Most word processors have two search and replace modes. In the first mode, the word processor automatically makes all the replacements in the file. In the second mode, the word processor requires you to approve each replacement. This is safer because you may not want to make the change everywhere.  Search and replace is sometimes called find and replace.   

search_engine
Search engines are programs that search documents for specified keywords and returns a list of the documents where the keywords were found. A search engine is really a general class of programs, however, the term is often used to specifically describe systems like Google, Bing and Yahoo! Search that enable users to search for documents on the World Wide Web. 
Web Search Engines
Typically, Web search engines work by sending out a spider to fetch as many documents as possible. Another program, called an indexer, then reads these documents and creates an index based on the words contained in each document. Each search engine uses a proprietary algorithm to create its indices such that, ideally, only meaningful results are returned for each query.
As many website owners rely on search engines to send traffic to their website, and entire industry has grown around the idea of optimizing Web content to improve your placement in search engine results. Learn more about search engine optimization (SEO) in this Webopedia' definition.

SEO
SEO is short for search engine optimization or search engine optimizer. 
Search engine optimization is a methodology of strategies, techniques and tactics used to increase the amount of visitors to a website by obtaining a high-ranking placement in the search results page of a search engine (SERP) -- including Google, Bing, Yahoo and other search engines.
It is common practice for Internet users to not click through pages and pages of search results, so where a site ranks in a search is essential for directing more traffic toward the site. The higher a website naturally ranks in organic results of a search, the greater the chance that that site will be visited by a user.

search_engine_services
A phrase used to describe a collection of services offered by a third-party vendor that are designed to assist organizations and businesses to obtain exposure and a better search engine ranking  --  or placement   for their website. Typical search engine services will include search engine optimization (SEO) services and search engine marketing (SEM) services as well as website promotion and website optimization services.
See White hat SEO. Also see How Web Search Engines Work in the Did You Know…? Section of Webopedia.

searchandizing
The word is a combination of  search and merchandizing. It is an electronic commerce term used to describe using your own site search to promote products when users search for certain keywords or phrases, akin to merchandizing a retail store for up-selling, cross-selling or promoting specific merchandise. Also called multi-faceted search.

seat
(1) The installation of system memory or other modules and chips into a computer system. (2) A single client workstation in software licensing.

SECAM
Short for SIquentiel Couleur @ Mimoire (Sequential Color with Memory), SECAM is a color TV standard that was introduced in the early 1960 in France. SECAM uses the same resolution as PAL (625 lines) but transmits the color information sequentially: R-Y on one line and B-Y on the next. SECAM is used sparingly around the world and can be found in France, parts of Greece, Eastern Europe, Russia, and Africa.

SECC
Short for Single Edge Contact Cartridge SECC is a processor cartridge that plugs into a motherboard on Slot1. SECC was designed to hold the Intel Pentium II as well as external cache. SECC was replaced with the newer SECC2 technology that was designed to hold the Intel Pentium II 450 and Pentium III. See also Slot 1.

secondary_memory
Secondary memory (or secondary storage) is the slowest and cheapest form of memory. It cannot be processed directly by the CPU. It must first be copied into primary storage (also known as RAM).
Secondary memory devices include magnetic disks like hard drives and floppy disks ; optical disks such as CDs and CDROMs ; and magnetic tapes, which were the first forms of secondary memory.


Secret_Storage_technology
The term used to describe a technology for encrypting and hiding data on a hard drive, flash drive, or when transferring files. Secret Storage is a portion of encrypted data, hidden in some file or FAT/FAT32/NTFS partition. To the end-user it looks like a folder in which he may add files and folders and protect it with a password. Secret Storage technology was developed in 2009 by Badevlad Software Company.

Section_508
The legislation referred to as "Section 508" is actually an amendment to the Workforce Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Section 508 requires that electronic and information technology (IT) that is developed or purchased by the Federal Government is accessible by people with disabilities. * In 1998, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act to require Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities.  Inaccessible technology interferes with an individual's ability to obtain and use information quickly and easily. Section 508 was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology, to make available new opportunities for people with disabilities, and to encourage development of technologies that will help achieve these goals.  The law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology. Under Section 508 (29 U.S.C. . 794d), agencies must give disabled employees and members of the public access to information that is comparable to the access available to others.  * [ Source: Section 508 Web site] 

sector
)The smallest unit that can be accessed on a disk. When a disk undergoes a low-level format, it is divided into tracks and sectors. The tracks are concentric circles around the disk and the sectors are segments within each circle. For example, a formatted disk might have 40 tracks, with each track divided into 10 sectors. The operating system and disk drive keep tabs on where information is stored on the disk by noting its track and sector number.  Modern hard disk drives use a technique called zoned-bit recording in which tracks on the outside of the disk contain more sectors than those on the inside.  A sector that cannot be used due to a physical flaw on the disk is called a bad sector.  

sector_number
A number that uniquely identifies the physical sector on a disk.See sector.See also track.

secure-delete
Secure delete means to overwrite data in a file when the file has been deleted from your computer. Using the Windows operating system, when a file is deleted it is simply removed from the file system table, so the file exists on the hard drive until other data overwrites it. During this time the file could be recovered.
A number of software tools exist that claim to securely delete files by ensuring the sectors on the hard drive that the file occupied prior to delete is immediately overwritten with other data. Programs that overwrite the data multiple times are considered more secure. There are similar utilities, called space wipers, that will write data to all free space on the hard drive to remove all traces of any file that has been deleted on the Windows system.

Secure_Electronic_Transaction
SET, short for Secure Electronic Transaction, is a standard that will enable secure credit card transactions on the Internet. SET has been endorsed by virtually all the major players in the electronic commerce arena, including Microsoft, Netscape, Visa, and Mastercard. By employing  digital signatures, SET will enable merchants to verify that buyers are who they claim to be. And it will protect buyers by providing a mechanism for their credit card number to be transferred directly to the credit card issuer for verification and billing without the merchant being able to see the number.

secure_server
A Web server that supports any of the major security protocols, like SSL, that encrypt and decrypt messages to protect them against third party tampering. Making purchases from a secure Web server ensures that a user's payment or personal information can be translated into a secret code that's difficult to crack. Major security protocols include SSL, SHTTP, PCT, and IPSec.
See the Server Types page in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia for a comparison of server types.

security
(n.) In the computer industry, the term security -- or the phrase computer security -- refers to techniques for ensuring that data stored in a computer cannot be read or compromised by any individuals without authorization. Most computer security measures involve data encryption and passwords. Data encryption is the translation of data into a form that is unintelligible without a deciphering mechanism. A password is a secret word or phrase that gives a user access to a particular program or system.

security_architecture
A term used by the  Symantec Security Response Center to refer to a plan and set of principles that describe the security services that a system is required to provide to meet the needs of its users, the system elements required to implement the services, and also the performance levels required in the elements to deal with the threat environment. Also see The Difference Between a Virus, Worm and Trojan Horse in the Did You Know? section of Webopedia. 

Security_Assertion_Markup_Language
See SAML.

security_exploit
Another term for security vulnerability, a security exploit is an unintended and unpatched flaw in software code that exposes it to potential exploitation by hackers or malicious software code such as viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other forms of malware.  Security exploits may result from a combination of software bugs, weak passwords or software already infected by a computer virus or worm, and these security exploits require patches, or software fixes, in order to prevent the potential for unauthorized access or compromised integrity.  Also see vulnerability scanning and The Difference Between a Virus, Worm and Trojan Horse  in the Did You Know? section of Webopedia. 

security_information_management
SIM is short for security information management. It is a type of software that automates the collection of event log data from security devices, such as such as firewalls, proxy servers, intrusion-detection systems and antivirus software. The SIM translates the logged data into correlated and simplified formats. Many SIM architecture provides security reporting, analysis and reporting for Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA, Basel II, FISMA and Visa CISP compliance audits.
SIM is also called security event management (SEM).

security_manager

security_policy
A security policy is a document that outlines the rules, laws and practices for computer network access. This document regulates how an organization will manage, protect and distribute its sensitive information (both corporate and client information) and lays the framework for the computer-network-oriented security of the organization.  See also security.

security_software

&lt;!--
.style1 {
	color: #FF0000;
}
--&gt;
A general phrase used to describe any software that  provides security for a computer or network. There are  many types of security software including antivirus  software, encryption software, firewall software  and spyware removal  software. Additionally, many operating systems also come preloaded with security  software and tools. The two most common types of security software used for  personal computer security are antivirus  software (virus protection software) and antispyware software (spyware  removal software).

security_software_disabler_Trojan
A type of Trojan horse designed stop or kill security programs such as an antivirus program or firewall without the user knowing. This Trojan type is normally combined with another type of Trojan as a payload. See also Trojan horse.

security_vulnerability
An unintended flaw in software code or a system that leaves it open to the potential for exploitation in the form of unauthorized access or malicious behavior such as viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other forms of malware.  Also referred to as security exploits, security vulnerabilities can result from software bugs, weak passwords or software that’s already been infected by a computer virus or script code injection, and these security vulnerabilities require patches, or fixes, in order to prevent the potential for compromised integrity by hackers or malware.  Also see vulnerability scanning and The Difference Between a Virus, Worm and Trojan Horse  in the Did You Know? section of Webopedia. 

seek_time
Refers to the time a program or device takes to locate a particular piece of data. For disk drives, the terms seek time and access time are often used interchangeably. Technically speaking, however, the access time is often longer the seek time because it includes a brief latency period.  

segment
(1) In networks, a section of a network that is bounded by bridges, routers or switches. Dividing an Ethernet into multiple segments is one of the most common ways of increasing available bandwidth on the LAN. If segmented correctly, most network traffic will remain within a single segment, enjoying the full 10 Mbps bandwidth. Hubs and switches are used to connect each segment to the rest of the LAN.  (2) In virtual memory systems, a variable-sized portion of data that is swapped in and out of main memory. Contrast with page.  (3) In graphics, a piece of a polyline, which is a fixed-sized portion of data.

segmented_address_space
An address space logically divided into sections, called segments. To access a particular memory location, a program must specify both the segment number and the offset within that segment. In contrast, a flat address space consists of simple memory addresses that start at 0 and increment to the maximum address.  Intel's 16-bit x86 architecture uses a segmented addressing model, and consequently so do DOS and older versions of Windows. Starting with 80386 microprocessor, however, the x86 architecture supports a flat addressing architecture. Newer versions of Windows, including Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT, use a flat addressing scheme. The Mac OS has always used a flat addressing model.  In some cases, it's necessary to convert from one addressing model to another. This is called thunking. 

select
To choose an object so that you can manipulate it in some way. In graphical user interfaces, you usually need to select an object -- an icon, file, folder, and so on -- before you can do anything with it. To select an object, you move the pointer to the object and click a mouse button. In many applications, you can select blocks of text by positioning the pointer at an end-point of the block and then dragging the pointer over the block. 

selection
Also called a decision, one of the three basic logic structures in computer programming. The other two logic structures are sequence and loop.
In a selection structure, a question is asked, and depending on the answer, the program takes one of two courses of action, after which the program moves on to the next event.
This structure is sometimes referred to as an if-then-else because it directs the program to perform in this way: If Condition A is True then perform Action X elseperform Action Y.

selective_backup
A type of backup where only the user specified files and directories are backed up. A selective backup is commonly used for backing up files which change frequently or in situations where the space available to store backups is limited. Also called a partial backup.

self_extracting_file
A type of file that contains other files that have been compressed (typically through a ZIP program) for more efficient transfer of the data. The self-extracting file contains within it the program software needed to "unzip" the file and execute the intended application. The end user, therefore, does not need any special software to execute the file. Simply executing the file (which typically involves saving the files on a computer��s hard drive) will unzip the data and run the application.  Self-extracting files, which typically end with the .EXE file extension, are commonly used to transfer large data files efficiently. For example, a software upgrade will often come in the form of a self-extracting file that a user can download from the Internet or detach from an e-mail and execute. Self-extracting files typically can be deleted once they have been executed.

self_garbling_virus
A type of computer virus that will attempt to hide from an antivirus program by garbling its own code. When a self-garbling virus propagates it will change the encoding of its own code to trick antivirus programs and stay hidden on the computer system.

self_service
A phrase that describes methods and processes a business uses to allow its customers to complete most steps in purchasing products or services on their own -- such as shopping in a retail store or making a call to arrange a service. Self-service also extends to Web-based transactions and CRM (customer relationship management) whereby customers manage account information primarily on their own.
See also customer self-service (CSS).

selfie
A slang term used to describe a photo that is taken of oneself for the purpose of uploading it to social networking sites  and image sharing websites, such as Facebook, Instagram or Imgur. To take a selfie, the right or left arm is extended with the camera held backwards. The selfie shows the person's arm is shown extended in front holding the camera or smartphone device.

SELinux
Short for Security-enhanced Linux, SELinux is a Linux variation that can be fully integrated into the Linux 2.6 kernel series and also several Linux distributions. SELinux has no concept of a root user, instead it includes enhanced security functionality through enforced mandatory access controls (MAC). SELinux was created by the National Security Agency as an example of how mandatory access controls, which can confine the actions of any process, can be added into Linux.  It was released to the  open_source.html development community in 2000.

SEM
SEM is short for search engine marketing.
SEM is a type of Internet marketing associated with the researching, submitting and positioning of a website within search engines to achieve maximum visibility and increase your share of paid and/or organic traffic referrals from search engines.
SEM involves things such as search engine optimization (SEO), keyword research, competitive analysis, paid listings and other search engine services that will increase search traffic to your site.

Semantic_Web
An extension of the current Web that provides an easier way to find, share, reuse and combine information. It is based on machine-readable information and builds on XML technology's capability to define customized tagging schemes and RDF's (Resource Description Framework) flexible approach to representing data. The Semantic Web provides common formats for the interchange of data (where on the Web there is only an interchange of documents). It also provides a common language for recording how data relates to real world objects, allowing a person or a machine to start off in one database, and then move through an unending set of databases which are connected not by wires but by being about the same thing.

Semantic_Web_application
A term used to describe Web-based applications that incorporates principles or technologies of the W3C Semantic Web, such as RDF, OWL and other metadata standards. See also "What Is The Semantic Web?" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia.

Semantically_Interlinked_Online_Communities
See under SIOC.

semantics
In linguistics, the study of meanings. In computer science, the term is frequently used to differentiate the meaning of an instruction from its format. The format, which covers the spelling of language components and the rules controlling how components are combined, is called the language's syntax. For example, if you misspell a command, it is a syntax error. If, on the other hand, you enter a legal command that does not make any sense in the current context, it is a semantic error.   

semaphore
A hardware or software flag. In multitasking systems, a semaphore is a variable with a value that indicates the status of a common resource. It's used to lock the resource that is being used. A process needing the resource checks the semaphore to determine the resource's status and then decides how to proceed. 

semi_free_software
Refers to any software that is not free but gives permission to individuals to use, copy, distribute, and modify the software for non-profit purposes only. The Free Software Foundation (FSF) also includes the ability to distribute modified versions in its definition of semi-free software.

semiconductor
A material that is neither a good conductor of electricity (like copper) nor a good insulator (like rubber). The most common semiconductor materials are silicon and germanium. These materials are then doped to create an excess or lack of electrons.
Computer chips, both for CPU and memory, are composed of semiconductor materials. Semiconductors make it possible to miniaturize electronic components, such as transistors. Not only does miniaturization mean that the components take up less space, it also means that they are faster and require less energy.


sentinel_value
(sen´t&-n&l val´ū) (n.) In programming, a special value that is used to terminate a loop. The sentinel value typically is chosen so as to not be a legitimate data value that the loop will encounter and attempt to perform with. For example, in a loop algorithm that computes non-negative integers, the value "-1" can be set as the sentinel value as the computation will never encounter that value as a legitimate processing output.  Also referred to as a flag value or a signal value.

SEO_PR
A combination of the words Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and public relations (PR). It is a combination of writing press releases and other marketing papers for search engine optimization purposes to generate leads as well as traffic to a Web site. 
Also called Internet Public Relations.

SEO_services
An SEO service provider utilizes the practice of search engine optimization to increase the amount of visitors to a Web site by obtaining high-ranking placements in the search results page of search engines (SERP). Typically, a business will hire a service provider to improve its organic Google search result listings. 
SEO services help to ensure that a site is accessible to a search engine and improves the chances that the site will be found and ranked highly by the search engine. SEO service providers offer a wide range of packages and options for search engine optimization, ranging from one-time fees for smaller sites to monthly subscriptions for ongoing SEO efforts and support.
See related Webopedia term definitions including:  website optimization,  SEO PR, and Organic SEO.

SEO_Spam
In SEO (search engine optimization) terminology, it refers to SEO manipulation techniques that are used to increase search engine ranking, but violate the search engine's Terms of Service. See also Black Hat SEO.

sequence
(1) One of the three basic logic structures in computer programming. The other two logic structures are selection and loop.
In a sequence structure, an action, or event, leads to the next ordered action in a predetermined order. The sequence can contain any number of actions, but no actions can be skipped in the sequence. The program, when run, must perform each action in order with no possibility of skipping an action or branching off to another action.
All logic problems in programming can be solved by forming algorithms using only the three logic structures, and they can be combined in an infinite number of ways. The more complex the computing need, the more complex the combination of structures.

sequence_header
In MPEG encoding, a sequence header is placed before one or more groups of pictures and contains encoding and displaying parameters. To allow for better access and editing, many people place a sequence header after every GOP. Fewer sequence headers result in a smaller file in the final output. 

sequenced_packet_protocol
Abbreviated as SPP, a networking protocol that provides reliable transport of packets with flow control in environments where multiple transport connections are established. SPP uses destination ID reference numbers to identify the target end of a transport connection; sequence numbers to keep transmitted packets in the order in which they were sent; and acknowledge numbers that are assigned to the last packet in a sequence that a destination received properly to indicate that the transmission is complete and successful.

sequential_access
)Refers to reading or writing data records in sequential order, that is, one record after the other. To read record 10, for example, you would first need to read records 1 through 9. This differs from random access, in which you can read and write records in any order.  Some programming languages and operating systems distinguish between sequential-access data files and random-access data files, allowing you to choose between the two types. Sequential-access files are faster if you always access records in the same order. Random-access files are faster if you need to read or write records in a random order.  Devices can also be classified as sequential access or random access. For example, a tape drive is a sequential-access device because to get to point q on the tape, the drive needs to pass through points a through p. A disk drive, on the other hand, is a random-access device because the drive can access any point on the disk without passing through all intervening points.   

SerDes
Short for serializer/deserializer, SerDes is an integrated circuit transceiver used to convert parallel and serial data. SerDes converts data into a serial data stream and then transmits it over a differential media. SerDes reduces the number of data paths and also the number of connecting PINs (or wires) required.

serial
One by one. Serial data transfer refers to transmitting data one bit at a time. The opposite of serial is parallel, in which several bits are transmitted concurrently.   

Serial_ATA
Often abbreviated SATA or S-ATA, an evolution of the Parallel ATA physical storage interface. Serial ATA is a serial link -- a single cable with a minimum of four wires creates a point-to-point connection between devices. Transfer rates for Serial ATA begin at 150MBps. One of the main design advantages of Serial ATA is that the thinner serial cables facilitate more efficient airflow inside a form factor and also allow for smaller chassis designs. In contrast, IDE cables used in parallel ATA systems are bulkier than Serial ATA cables and can only extend to 40cm long, while Serial ATA cables can extend up to one meter. 
Serial ATA supports all ATA and ATAPI devices.
 

serial_mouse
A mouse that connects to a computer via a serial port. The other common type of mouse is a PS/2 mouse, which plugs into a PS/2 mouse port. 

serial_peripheral_interface
(1) Short for Serial Peripheral Interface, a full-duplex synchronous serial interface for connecting low-/medium-bandwidth external devices using four wires. SPI devices communicate using a master/slave relationship over two data lines and two control lines:   Master Out Slave In (MOSI): supplies the output data from the master to the inputs of the slaves.  Master In Slave Out (MISO): supplies the output data from a slave to the input of the master. It is important to note that there can be no more than one slave that is transmitting data during any particular transfer.  Serial Clock (SCLK): a control line driven by the master, regulating the flow of data bits.  Slave Select (SS): a control line that allows slaves to be turned on and off with  hardware control.   (2) Short for System Packet Interface, a point-to-point interface standard, allows network equipment designers to develop an array of next-generation multi-service switches and routers to support multi-service traffic with aggregate bandwidths up to OC-192 (10 Gb/s) and beyond, enabling them to dramatically increase system performance. It is a family of Interoperability Agreements from the Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF) which include:  System Packet Interface Level 5 (SPI-5): OC-768 System Interface for Physical and Link Layer Devices. (OIF documentation) System Packet Interface Level 4 (SPI-4) Phase 2: OC-192 System Interface for Physical and Link Layer Devices.(OIF documentation) System Physical Interface Level 4 (SPI-4) Phase 1: A System Interface for Interconnection Between Physical and Link Layer, or Peer-to-Peer Entities Operating at an OC-192 Rate (10 Gb/s)  (OIF documentation) System Packet Interface Level 3: OC-48 System Interface for Physical and Link Layer Devices (OIF documentation) 

serial_port
A port, or interface, that can be used for serial communication, in which only 1 bit is transmitted at a time.
Most serial ports on personal computers conform to the RS-232C or RS-422 standards. A serial port is a general-purpose interface that can be used for almost any type of device, including modems, mice, and printers (although most printers are connected to a parallel port).


Serial_Storage_Architecture
Abbreviated as SSA, Serial Storage Architecture  is an open industry-standard interface that provides a high-performance, serial interconnect technology used to connect disk devices and host adapters. SSA serializes the SCSI data set and using loop architecture that requires only two wires: transmit and receive. The SSA interface also supports full-duplex, so it can transmit and receive data simultaneously at full speed.

serialization
The conversion of an object instance to a data stream of byte values in order to prepare it for transmission.

serif
)A small decorative line added as embellishment to the basic form of a character. Typefaces are often described as being serif or sans serif (without serifs). The most common serif typeface is Times Roman. A common sans serif typeface is Helvetica.   

SERP
Short for search engine results page, the Web page that a search engine returns with the results of its search. The major search engines typically display three kinds of listings on their SERPs. Listings that have been indexed by the search engine's spider, listings that have been indexed into the search engine's directory by a human, and listings that are paid to be listed by the search engine.
Also see How Web Search Engines Work in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia.

server
(ser´ver) (n.) A computer or device on a network that manages network resources. There are many different types of servers. For example:


File server: a computer and storage device dedicated to storing files. Any user on the network can store files on the server.
Print server: a computer that manages one or more printers, and a network server is a computer that manages network traffic.
Database server: a computer system that processes database queries.

Servers are often dedicated, meaning that they perform no other tasks besides their server tasks. On multiprocessing operating systems, however, a single computer can execute several programs at once. A server in this case could refer to the program that is managing resources rather than the entire computer.

server_appliance
Also called an appliance server, a specialized server that is designed for ease of installation and maintenance. Server appliances have their hardware and software bundled in the product, so all applications are pre-installed. The appliance is plugged into an existing network and can begin working almost immediately, with little configuration. It is designed to run with little or no support.  Server appliances provide Internet sharing, FTP services, e-mail, VPN connections, firewall services, print and file serving and also operates as a Web server. Access to the server appliance is through a Web browser.  A server appliance can be integrated into existing networks in small enterprises or homes. It is not practical for large enterprises to utilize server appliances.

Server_Appliance_Kit
Abbreviated as SAK, the Server Appliance Kit, used with Microsoft Windows 2000 Server or Advanced Server with Service Pack 2, enables OEMs to build fixed-function server appliance products based on the Microsoft Windows OS. This includes a variety of server appliances such as Web server appliances, VPN appliances, NAS appliances, or backup and recovery appliances for example.

server_blade
A single circuit board populated with components such as processors, memory, and network connections that are usually found on multiple boards. Server blades are designed to slide into existing servers. Server blades are more cost-efficient, smaller and consume less power than traditional box-based servers. Also see the Server Types page in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia for a comparison of server types.

server_cage_area
In data center terminology, the server cage area is where the company and their customers, where applicable, would store data center equipment. This area is protected from personnel access.

server_farm
Also referred to as server cluster, computer farm or ranch. A server farm is a group of networked servers that are housed in one location. A server farm streamlines internal processes by distributing the workload between the individual components of the farm and expedites computing processes by harnessing the power of multiple servers. The farms rely on load-balancing software that accomplishes such tasks as tracking demand for processing power from different machines, prioritizing the tasks and scheduling and rescheduling them depending on priority and demand that users put on the network. When one server in the farm fails, another can step in as a backup.   Combining servers and processing power into a single entity has been relatively common for many years in research and academic institutions. Today, more and more companies are utilizing server farms as a way of handling the enormous amount of computerization of tasks and services that they require.   A Web server farm, or Web farm, refers to either a Web site that runs off of more than one server or an ISP that provides Web hosting services using multiple servers.  Also see the Server Types page in the quick reference section of Webopedia for a comparison of server types.

smb2_protocol
Short for Server Message Block 2, SMB2 is a file transfer protocol commonly used by network-attached storage (NAS) devices and file servers for sharing files and data. SMB2 first debuted with the release of Microsoft's Windows Vista in 2007 as a successor to the original SMB protocol, and it's now supported by Mac OS X (as of the OS X Mavericks release), Linux and Samba as well.
The SMB2 protocol offers better performance and increased security over the original protocol. Apple made the switch to SMB2 in the Mavericks release after moving from its own proprietary SMBX protocol, which Apple had developed to replace the aging AFP (AppleTalk Filing Protocol) file sharing protocol used by the company since the 1980s.

server_mirroring
Utilizing a backup server that duplicates all the processes and transactions of the primary server. If, for any reason, the primary server fails, the backup server can immediately take its place without any down -time.  Server mirroring is an expensive but effective strategy for achieving fault tolerance. It's expensive because each server must be mirrored by an identical server whose only purpose is to be there in the event of a failure. A less expensive technique that is becoming more and more popular is clustering.  Also see the Server Types page in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia for a comparison of server types.

server_operating_system
A server operating system, also called a server OS, is an operating system specifically designed to run on servers, which are specialized computers that operate within a client/server architecture to serve the requests of client computers on the network.

WEBOPEDIA FACTOID
Using server hardware sales data, IDC reports that 28% of servers run Linux compared to 50% of servers running Windows. Other popular server operating systems include Unix and z/OS.


The server operating system, or server OS, is the software layer on top of which other software programs, or applications, can run on the server hardware. Server operating systems help enable and facilitate typical server roles such as Web server, mail server, file server, database server, application server and print server.
Popular server operating systems include Windows Server, Mac OS X Server, and variants of Linux such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.

server_virtualization
Server virtualization is the partitioning of a physical server into smaller virtual servers to help maximize your server resources. In server virtualization the resources of the server itself are hidden, or masked, from users, and software is used to divide the physical server into multiple virtual environments, called virtual or private servers. This is in contrast to dedicating one server to a single application or task.
Common Uses of Server Virtualization
One common usage of this technology is in Web servers. Using virtual Web servers is a popular way to provide low-cost Web hosting services. Instead of requiring a separate computer for each Web server, dozens of virtual servers can co-reside on the same computer.
Benefits of Server Virtualization
Server virtualization has many benefits. For example, it lets each virtual server run its own operating system and each virtual server can also be independently rebooted of one another. Server virtualization also reduces costs because less hardware is required so that alone saves a business money.

server_side
Occurring on the server side of a client-server system. For example, on the World Wide Web, CGI scripts are server-side applications because they run on the Web server. In contrast, JavaScript scripts are client-side because they are executed by your browser (the client). Java applets can be either server-side or client-side depending on which computer (the server or the client) executes them. 

server_side_include
Abbreviated SSI. A type of HTML comment that directs the Web server to dynamically generate data for the Web page whenever it is requested. The basic format for SSIs are:  <!--#command tag="value">  Where #command can be any of various commands supported by the Web server. The simplest command is #include, which inserts the contents of another file. This is especially useful for ensuring that boilerplate components, such as headers and footers, are the same on all pages throughout a Web site. To change a boilerplate element, you need only modify the include file, instead of updating every individual Web page.  SSIs can also be used to execute programs and insert the results. They therefore represent a powerful tool for Web developers.  There is no official standard for SSIs, so every Web server is free to support different SSIs in different manners. However, many SSI commands, such as #include and #exec, have become de facto standards.  Web pages that contain SSIs often end with a .shtml extension, though this is not a requirement. The filename extension enables the Web server to differentiate those pages that need to be processed before they are sent to the browser. 

service_bureau
Short for prepress service bureau, a company that provides a variety of desktop publishing services. In particular, service bureaus have imagesetters that can produce high-resolution output on paper or film. This is a necessary step before printing a document with offset printing.  In addition to providing high-resolution output, many service bureaus also offer scanning services, as well as general consultancy. Some service bureaus have computers equipped with desktop publishing software which you can rent by the hour.   

Service_Level_Agreement
Abbreviated SLA, a contract between an ASP and the end user which stipulates and commits the ASP to a required level of service. An SLA should contain a specified level of service, support options, enforcement or penalty provisions for services not provided, a guaranteed level of system performance as relates to downtime or uptime, a specified level of customer support and what software or hardware will be provided and for what fee.

service_node
Another name for an edge switch.

service_pack
(n.) An update to a software version that fixes an existing problem, such as a bug, or provides enhancements to the product that will appear in the next version of the product. When the new product version is released, it usually contains the fixes and updates from the service pack. Service packs can either be downloaded or ordered directly from the company.

service_patch
See patch.

service_review
In electronic commerce, service review is an option for customers to rate a company's service, such as a hotel or landscaper, and provide a testimonial using an online submission form. Often, the company will include a URL on printed literature or e-mail marketing to invite customers to review their service after a transaction has been completed. Service reviews are frequently used to help a business build a positive business reputation.

servlet
A small program that runs on a server. The term usually refers to a Java applet that runs within a Web server environment. This is analogous to a Java applet that runs within a Web browser environment.  Java servlets are becoming increasingly popular as an alternative to CGI programs. The biggest difference between the two is that a Java applet is persistent. This means that once it is started, it stays in memory and can fulfill multiple requests. In contrast, a CGI program disappears once it has fulfilled a request. The persistence of Java applets makes them faster because there's no wasted time in setting up and tearing down the process. 

session
Same as user session.

session_border_controller
A session border controller (SBC) is a piece of network equipment or a collection of functions that control real-time session traffic at the signaling, call control, and  packet layers as they cross a notional packet-to-packet network border between networks or between network segments. SBCs are critical to the deployment of VoIP networks, because they address the inability of real-time session traffic to cross network address translation (NAT) device or firewall boundaries.  [Source:  Heavy Reading - VOIP Session Border Controls]

session_controller
A session controller, abbreviated as SC, is used to connect VoIP applications and systems into a single network. It provides Layer 5 routing and control to manage real time traffic between IP networks. Session controllers addresses issues concerning network security, call signaling, call control, QoS, and session routing. See also Session Border Controller.

session_cookie
Also called a transient cookie, a cookie that is erased when the user closes the Web browser. The session cookie is stored in temporary memory and is not retained after the browser is closed. Session cookies do not collect information from the user��s computer. They typically will store information in the form of a session identification that does not personally identify the user.  Compare with persistent cookie.

session_hijacking
(n.) Also referred to as TCP session hijacking, a security attack on a user session over a protected network. The most common method of session hijacking is called IP spoofing, when an attacker uses source-routed IP packets to insert commands into an active communication between two nodes on a network and disguising itself as one of the authenticated users. This type of attack is possible because authentication typically is only done at the start of a TCP session. Another type of session hijacking is known as a man-in-the-middle attack, where the attacker, using a sniffer, can observe the communication between devices and collect the data that is transmitted.

Session_Initiated_Protocol
See SIP.

SET
(1) Short for Secure Electronic Transaction (2) Short for single electron transistor 

set_top_box
Often abbreviated STB, an electronic device that is connected to a communication channel, such as a phone, ISDN or cable television line, and produces output on a conventional television screen.  Set-top boxes are commonly used to receive and decode digital television broadcasts and to interface with the Internet through the user��s television instead of a PC. Set-top boxes fall into several categories, from the simplest that receive and unscramble incoming television signals to the more complex that will also function as multimedia desktop computers that can run a variety of advanced services such as videoconferencing, home networking, IP telephony, video-on-demand (VoD) and high-speed Internet TV services.

SETL
Short for Set Theory as a Language (or Set Language), SETL is a high-level programming language that's based on the mathematical theory of sets. It was developed in the early 1970's by mathematician Professor J. Schwartz. SETL is an interpreted language with a syntax that is resembles C and in many cases similar to Perl. In SETL every statement is terminated by a semicolon. Variable names are case-insensitive and are automatically determined by their last assignment.

setup
(v) To install and configure hardware or software. Most Windows applications come with a program called SETUP.EXE or INSTALL.EXE, which installs the software on the computer's  hard disk.  (n) The configuration of hardware or software. 

SFA
Abbreviated SFA, sales force automation is a technique of using software to automate the business tasks of sales, including order processing, contact management, information sharing, inventory monitoring and control, order tracking, customer management, sales forecast analysis and employee performance evaluation.
SFA is often used interchangeably with CRM; however, CRM does not necessarily imply automation of sales tasks.
Learn more about sales force automation, CRM and business intelligence on eCRM Guide.

SFLC
Short for Software Freedom Law Center, SFLC is an organization who provides legal representation and law-related services to protect and advance Free, Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS). Founded in 2005, SFLC represents many of the most important and well-established free software and open source projects.

SFTP
Short for Secure File Transfer Protocol, SFTP is a method of transferring files between computers over a secure SSH secure data stream.  Also called SSH. See also "How to Send Big Files Over The Internet" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia.

SGI
Short for Silicon Graphics Incorporated, a company based in Mountain View, California that provides computer hardware and software. SGI was founded by Dr. James Clark in 1982 and had its initial public offering in 1986. It is best known for products used to develop computer graphics such as those used to create special effects and animation in motion pictures.
The company has over 10,000 employees world-wide and had sales of $2.9 billion in 1996. SGI formed Silicon Studio in 1994 to serve the interactive digital media market. The company merged with MIPS Computer Systems in 1992, Alias Research and Wavefront Technologies in 1995, and Cray Research in 1996.
SGI provides a wide range of hardware and software products that include high-performance workstations and servers to meet the needs of those developing complex computer graphics or manipulating video images. New products include World Wide Webauthoring tools and servers.

SGML
Short forStandard Generalized Markup Language, a system for organizing and tagging elements of a document. SGML was developed and standardized by the International Organization for Standards (ISO) in 1986. SGML itself does not specify any particular formatting; rather, it specifies the rules for tagging elements. These tagscan then be interpreted to format elements in different ways.
SGML is used widely to manage large documents that are subject to frequent revisions and need to be printed in different formats. Because it is a large and complex system, it is not yet widely used on personal computers. However, the growth of Internet, and especially the World Wide Web, is creating renewed interest in SGML because the World Wide Web uses HTML, which is one way of defining and interpreting tags according to SGML rules.


SGRAM
Abbreviation of Synchronous Graphic Random Access Memory, a type of DRAM used increasingly on video adapters and graphics accelerators. Like SDRAM, SGRAM can synchronize itself with the CPU bus clock up to speeds of 100 MHz. In addition, SGRAM uses several other techniques, such as masked writes and block writes, to increase bandwidth for graphics-intensive functions.  Unlike VRAM and WRAM, SGRAM is single-ported. However, it can open two memory pages at once, which simulates the dual-port nature of other video RAM technologies. 

SGSN
Short for Service GPRS Support Node, it mediates access to network resources on behalf of mobile subscribers (MS) and implements the packet scheduling policy between different QoS classes. It is responsible for establishing the Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context with the GGSN (gateway GPRS support node) upon activation. [Source: Adapted from Motorola Worldwide]

shade
In color, the word shade is used to reference how dark the color is. For example, hunter is a shade of green. Shades are derived from a combination of hue and black. Contrast with tint. See "The Science of Color" in the Did You Know... section of Webopedia. See also Webopedia's  Digital Camera Quick Reference.

shader
Used in 3-D computer graphics a shader is a small program or set of algorithms that determines how 3-D surface properties of objects are rendered, and how light interacts with the object within a 3-D computer program. Newer GPUs calculate shaders where previously it was an algorithm calculated by the CPU.

shadow_copy
In some Windows operating systems, when a system restore point is requested, a shadow copy of a file or folder is created. The shadow copy is essentially a previous version of the file or folder at a specific point. See System Restore.Also see Windows Vista. 

shadow-it
Shadow IT is a term that refers to Information Technology (IT) applications and infrastructure that are managed and utilized without the knowledge of the enterprise's IT department. Shadow IT can include hardware, software, web services or cloud applications that employees turn to without IT authorization to accomplish their tasks and projects.
Shadow IT has become more prevalent in companies as employees have increasingly turned to business-focused applications in the cloud to increase productivity. According to a report from Skyhigh Networks, the average employee uses 16.8 cloud services, including 2.9 content sharing services, 2.8 collaboration services, 2.6 social media services and 1.3 file sharing services.
The scope of Shadow IT has even been expanded in recent years to include personal technology that employees bring in to the workplace and utilize during work hours.

shadow_mask
A perforated metal sheet inside a color monitor. Most color monitor screens use cathode-ray tube (CRT) technology in which electrons are fired from an electron gun onto a phosphor coating on the screen's faceplate. The phosphor converts the kinetic energy of the electrons into light and is illuminated in tiny red, green and blue dots, which comprise the image that one sees when looking at a monitor's screen. The phosphors in a group are packed so closely together that the human eye can only perceive them as a single colored pixel. Before the electron beam reaches the phosphor dots it passes through the shadow mask, a perforated metal sheet that ensures that the electron beam hits only the correctly colored phosphor dots and does not illuminate more than one dot. Essentially, the shadow mask "masks" the electron beam, thereby forming a smaller and more rounded point that can hit individual phosphor dots. The shadow mask absorbs electrons that are directed at the wrong color phosphor. 

shadowing
A technique used to increase a computer's speed by using high-speed RAM memory in place of slower ROM memory (RAM is about three times as fast as ROM). On PCs, for example, all code to control hardware devices, such as keyboards, is normally executed in a special ROM chip called the BIOS ROM. However, this chip is slower than the general-purpose RAM that comprises main memory. Many PC manufacturers, therefore, configure their PCs to copy the BIOS code into RAM when the computer boots. The RAM used to hold the BIOS code is called shadow RAM. 

shared_contact_centre
A shared contact centre combine administrative, communication and financial expertise to create nerve centers for companies whose operations usually span worldwide. Shared Services sees the bringing together of one or more so-called "back office" functions and services often from geographically disparate areas - into a separate organization, the Shared Service Centre or SSC. The shared contact centre will usually handle operations relating to accounts payable; accounts receivable; general ledger; cash management; credit control; payroll, customer service and HR for a number of clients within one center.

shared_Ethernet
The traditional type of Ethernet, in which all hosts are connected to the same bus and compete with one another for bandwidth. In contrast, a switched Ethernet has one or more direct, point-to-point connections between hosts or segments. Devices connected to the Ethernet with a switch do not compete with each other and therefore have dedicated bandwidth. Also see the Ethernet Designations chart in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

shared_Ethernet_adapter
A shared Ethernet adapter is a Virtual I/O Server component that bridges a physical Ethernet adapter and Ethernet adapters. When using a Shared Ethernet Adapter, logical partitions on the virtual network can share access to the physical network and communicate with stand-alone servers and logical partitions on other systems. The Shared Ethernet Adapter eliminates the need for each client logical partition to a dedicated physical adapter to connect to the external network. [Source: Adapted from IBM]

shared_loop
In telecommunications, a shared loop refers to a loop, or subscriber line, that is shared by a competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) and an incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC), providing both DSL and voice service over the same line. In late 1999, the FCC passed the Advance Services Third Report and Order, allowing CLECs to gain access to the high-frequency portion of the local loop from incumbent providers. Prior to the ruling, ILECs were dismissing the notion that their lines could support both DSL and voice technology. However, it has been proven that the two technologies can coexist on the copper cables that the ILECs use. 

shared_WAP
Developed by the HomeRF Working Group, SWAP is a specification for wireless voice and data networking in the home.
 
SWAP works together with the PSTN network and the Internet through existing cordless telephone and wireless LAN technologies. It supports TDMA for interactive data transfer and CSMA/CA for high-speed packet transfer.

sharepoint_online_external_sharing
File sharing in Office 365 (Microsoft Office) for small business and enterprise users is available using the SharePoint Online environment. The SharePoint Online external sharing capabilities enables an organization to share documents with vendors, business partners or customers. Your company can view, share, and collaborate on your SharePoint Online sites as external viewers.
In SharePoint Online for enterprise the administrator allows sharing control for the whole company. Individual users within the company can then choose to activate the "external user invitation" feature. By default, sharing is turned off in SharePoint Online for small business. It can be turned on so the site owner can invite others to share documents via email.

SharePoint_Records_Management
The Records Management infrastructure of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) is designed to archive information no longer necessary in the daily running of the enterprise. The component is designed to ensure and protect the integrity of the content, register changes and authorization, ensure saved information is accessible only to authorized personal, and, most importantly, ensure that information cannot be altered or deleted. With Records Management, it is possible to block access at any point, if and when deemed necessary by the administrator.  See also "Records Management for Microsoft Office SharePoint Server" on SharePoint Briefing.com.

SharePoint_Solution_Packages
SharePoint Solution Package files are Microsoft's "preferred choice" for deploying Windows SharePoint Server (WSS) components. A Solution Package is a single compressed Windows Solution Package (.wsp) file containing all the necessary resources. A .wsp file can contain one or more WSS components.   See also "Creating and Deploying SharePoint Solution Files" on SharePoint Briefing.com.

shareware
(n.) Software distributed on the basis of an honor system. Most shareware is delivered free of charge, but the author usually requests that you pay a small fee if you like the program and use it regularly. By sending the small fee, you become registered with the producer so that you can receive service assistance and updates. You can copy shareware and pass it along to friends and colleagues, but they too are expected to pay a fee if they use the product.
Shareware is inexpensive because it is usually produced by a single programmer and is offered directly to customers. Thus, there are practically no packaging or advertising expenses.
Note that shareware differs from public-domain software in that shareware is copyrighted. This means that you cannot sell a shareware product as your own.

Shazam
The name of a popular music-discovery application for the Apple iPhone device. Shazam is a free application that helps users figure out the name of a catchy song being played on the radio, television or other place. Users simply hold their iPhone device up to the speaker playing the music and the Shazam application will attempt to identify the tune's album, artist and song title. The Shazam application is available for the iPhone, Android, and BlackBerry smartphones. See "iPod vs. MP3 Players: What's the Diff?"in the Did You Know... section of Webopedia. 

sheepdip
Also known as a footbath, a sheepdip is the process of checking physical media, such as floppy disks or CD-ROMs, for viruses before they are used in a computer. Typically, a computer that sheepdips is used only for that process and nothing else and is isolated from the other computers, meaning it is not connected to the network. Most sheepdips use at least two different antivirus programs in order to increase effectiveness. The goal of sheepdipping is to block viruses from entering systems rather than waiting until they manifest on user workstations at which time they will have already done their damage. Sheepdipping is not used for files downloaded from the Internet unless the files are first transferred to a physical removable medium and run through the sheepdip before loaded onto the workstation's hard drive.  The term comes from the practice in sheep farming of dipping the sheep in chemical solutions to clean their wool of fleas and lice or to promote the healing of skin irritations.

SheerVideo
A family of fast, lossless QuickTime and AVI codecs developed by BitJazz, SheerVideo is a production-based codec that is popular because of its support of Y'CbCr 4:4:4 and 4:2:2 formats, for both 10-bit and 8-bit channels, and for both progressive and interlaced data. It is also available for both Mac and PC for cross platform production environments.   See also "A Complete Guide to Video Codecs" on WebVideoUniverse.com. 

sheet_feeder
Also called cut-sheet feeder, a mechanism that holds a stack of paper and feeds each sheet into a printer one at a time. Sheet feeders are built into laser printers and are optional components for dot-matrix printers. Nearly all modern fax machines also come with sheet feeders, as do some optical scanners. 

shelfware
A slang term used to describe owning or licensing software that you don't actually need or use (e.g. it sits on a shelf). Shelfware is a phrase that is commonly used in the enterprise and corporations where volume license prices are given and the corporation purchases more software than really needed to obtain that discount.

shell
(1) The outermost layer of a program. Shell is another term for user interface. Operating systems and applications sometimes provide an alternative shell to make interaction with the program easier. For example, if the application is usually command driven, the shell might be a menu-driven system that translates the user's selections into the appropriate commands.  (2) Sometimes called command shell, a shell is the command processor interface. The command processor is the program that executes operating system commands. The shell, therefore, is the part of the command processor that accepts commands. After verifying that the commands are valid, the shell sends them to another part of the command processor to be executed.  UNIX systems offer a choice between several different shells, the most popular being the Cshell, the Bourne shell, and the Korn shell. Each offers a somewhat different command language.   

shell_enhancement
(n.) An enhancement made to a shell, or user interface, that affects the user's experience with an application or operating system's GUI. Shell enhancements often add functionality to the keyboard and mouse and menus, such as add-on toolbars and file managers, or can change the appearance of the interface to make elements like the desktop appear different.

shellshock
Shellshock is a bug that uses a vulnerability in the common Unix command execution shellbash (Bourne-Again SHell) to potentially enable hackers to take control of the machine and remotely execute arbitrary code directly into the system.
Because it preys on the Unix bash shell, which is utilized by most other major desktop and mobile operating systems like Linux, Mac OS X, iOS, Google Android and even Microsoft Windows, Shellshock has the potential to attack many types of systems and devices. To date, though, reports of Shellshock in the wild have been fairly limited, with the most prominent attacks targeting Web-facing servers and Network-Attached Storage devices (NAS).
It's also believed that operating systems like OS X and Windows do not expose bash to attacker-supplied input, which Shellshock would need to be able to control the computer. There remains the possibility, though, that other vulnerabilities could be discovered that would provide a way into the system for Shellshock or variants of the Shellshock bug.

shielded_twisted_pair
Often abbreviated STP, a type of copper telephone wiring in which each of the two copper wires that are twisted together are coated with an insulating coating that functions as a ground for the wires. The extra covering in shielded twisted pair wiring protects the transmission line from electromagnetic interference leaking into or out of the cable. STP cabling often is used in Ethernet networks, especially fast data rate Ethernets.
Contrast with UTP.

shift_clicking
Clicking click a mouse button while holding the Shift key down. In Microsoft Windows and Macintosh systems, shift clicking enables you to select multiple items. Normally, when you select an item, the system deselects the previously selected item. However, if you shift click an item, the previously selected item(s) remain selected. 

Shift_key
A key on computer keyboards that gives the other keys an alternate meaning. When combined with alphabetic keys, the Shift key causes the system to output a capital letter. The Shift key can also be combined with other keys to produce program -dependent results. 

shock_rating
A numerical value given to computer equipment to indicate its durability when physically dropped or subjected to another force. Shock rating is typically described as the acceleration of gravity (G) over a given time, typically a millisecond (msec). For example, a shock rating of 100-200 Gs/1 msec, equivalent to a drop of less than a foot, indicates that a device dropped from less than a foot will still operate as normal. A shock rating of 2,000 Gs indicates a device will operate after a 10-foot drop.

Shockwave
A technology developed by Macromedia, Inc. that enables Web pages to include multimedia objects. To create a shockwave object, you use Macromedia's multimedia authoring tool called Director, and then compress the object with a program called Afterburner. You then insert a reference to the "shocked" file in your Web page. To see a Shockwave object, you need the Shockwave plug-in, a program that integrates seamlessly with your Web browser. The plug-in is freely available from Macromedia's Web site as either a Netscape Navigator plug-in or an ActiveX control.  Shockwave supports audio, animation, video and even processes user actions such as mouse clicks. It runs on all Windows platforms as well as the Macintosh.     

SHOE
Short for Simple HTML Ontology Extension, SHOE is an XML-compatible extension to HTML that enables Web authors to  annotate their Web documents semantically with machine-readable knowledge. SHOE is designed to make it possible for robots and other Web-agents to gather meaningful information about Web pages and documents. It was developed by the Parallel Understanding Systems Group at the University of Maryland at College Park.

shopping_cart
A shopping cart is a piece of software that acts as an online store's catalog and ordering process. Typically, a shopping cart is the interface between a company's Web site and its deeper infrastructure, allowing consumers to select merchandise; review what they have selected; make necessary modifications or additions; and purchase the merchandise.   Shopping carts can be sold as independent pieces of software so companies can integrate them into their own unique online solution, or they can be offered as a feature from a service that will create and host a company's e-commerce site.  

short_message_service
Abbreviated as SMS, the transmission of short text messages to and from a mobile phone, fax machine and/or IP address. Messages must be no longer than 160 alpha-numeric characters and contain no images or graphics.
 
Once a message is sent, it is received by a Short Message Service Center (SMSC), which must then get it to the appropriate mobile device.

shortcut
A special type of file in some operating systems that points to another file or device. You can place shortcuts on the desktop to conveniently access files that may be stored deep in the directory structure. Double-clicking the shortcut icon is the same as double-clicking the actual file.  You can control how a shortcut appears by naming it anything you want and associating a particular icon with it. 

shortcut_key
A special key combination that causes a specific command to be executed. Typically, shortcut keys combine the Ctrl or Alt keys with some other keys. In Windows environments, for example, Ctrl +C is used as the shortcut key to copy. On PCs, the function keys are also often used as shortcut keys.  Most applications come with some shortcut keys already defined. Many, however, allow you to define your own shortcut keys for frequently-used commands. 

Shotgun
Shotgun, when capitalized, refers to the Shotgun modem-bonding technology. Shotgun technology bonds the data streams of two modems together to work intelligently over two ordinary phone lines and enables consumers to obtain Internet connections at speeds of up to 112 Kbps.

shoulder_surfing
Shoulder surfing refers to a direct observation, such as looking over a person's shoulder, to obtain information. In some cases shoulder surfing is done for no reason other than to get an answer, but in other instances it may constitute a security breach as the the person behind may be gleaning private information such as your PIN at a bank machine, or Credit card information as you enter it into a Web based shopping cart check-out. While shoulder surfing is most common in busy and crowed areas where the perpetrator is not as likely to be caught, shoulder surfing can also be done with the aid of binoculars or cameras from a more remote location.

shrink_wrap
The phrase used to describe a type of purchase or license agreement associated with shipped goods, such as boxed versions of computer  software purchased at a store. Shrink-wrap licenses usually means that the  "agreement is bound with the product by plastic wrap (shrink wrap)", and will specify rights of use, fees, warranties and limitations of liability and End User License Agreement (EULA) printed on paper inside the product box or packaging. Consumers make the purchase, remove the shrink wrap and open the product. Shrink wrap agreements usually specify that opening the product constitutes acceptance of the terms and EULA. See "Is Software Ownership the Same as Licensing?" in Webopedia's "Did You Know...?" section.

shunt
In computers and electronics, a shunt is the conductive sleeve that is placed over the jumper pins to close an electrical circuit. See also jumper for a better understanding of this term.

shut_down
(1) To turn the power off.  (2) In Windows 95 and Windows 98, the normal way to turn a computer off is to select Start->Shut Down   

shutter
In photography and digital photography applications, the shutter is the device on the camera that opens and closes to control how long the focal plane is exposed to light. On a video camera there is no physical shutter, instead the camera��s CCD samples light for an appropriate length of time, and then shuts off.

shutter_glasses
In virtual reality and 3D environments, shutter glasses are worn by the viewer to perceive a 3D image when looking at an appropriately configured display system. Shutters in the glasses are synchronized with the display system, which alternately presents a left or right eye image. 

shutter_priority
A digital camera setting that allows the user to set the shutter  speed and allows the camera determine the aperture size (also called f-stop) for a correctly exposed image.
See also "The Digital Camera Picture" in Webopedia's Quick Reference section.

shutter_speed
In photography and digital photography the shutter speed is the unit of measurement which determines how long shutter remains open as the picture is taken. The slower the shutter speed, the longer the exposure time. The shutter speed and aperture together control the total amount of light reaching the sensor. Shutter speeds are expressed in seconds or fractions of a second. For example 2, 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/15, 1/30, 1/60, 1/125, 1/250, 1/500, 1/1000, 1/2000, 1/4000, 1/8000. Each speed increment halves the amount of light.
See also aperture.

shylock_malware
Shylock refers to a family of malware that relies on browser-based man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and fake digital certificates to intercept network traffic and inject code into banking websites. The Shylock malware was first discovered in February 2011 and derives its name from references in the code to Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice.  The Shylock malware code is designed to trick customers into providing banking login and account details to hackers instead of to the bank’s customer service department. Some Shylock strains even have the ability to open a fake customer service chat window on an infected computer to enable cybercriminals to prompt the user for their sensitive account information.  Newer strains of the Shylock malware have added the ability to detect whether the malware is running in a virtual machine (VM) that’s being analyzed by malware researchers. The Shylock malware does this to help make analysis more difficult and avoid detection by security researchers.   Virtual machines are frequently employed by security teams to test programs in simulated environments to more easily detect malicious behavior. When the Shylock malware detects it is being run in a virtual environment, the code will shut down the program.

SID
Short for security identifier, a security feature of the Windows NT and 2000 operating systems. The SID is a unique name (alphanumeric character string) that is used to identify an object, such as a user or a group of users in a networkof NT/2000 systems.
Windows grants or denies access and privileges to resources based on ACLs, which use SIDs to uniquely identify users and their group memberships. When a user requests access to a resource, the user��s SID is checked by the ACL to determine if that user is allowed to perform that action or if that user is part of a group that is allowed to perform that action.

side_scroller
Side-scroller, or side-scrolling, refers to a game genre where the gameplay is viewed from a side angle and the characters move from left to right of the screen. Most side-scrollers have limited actions, allowing the character to do basic moves such as attack in a straight line movement, move forward or back (left to right), run, jump and climb. Gamers will usually advance in a side-scroller by completing levels.

SideJacking
Term used to describe the malicious act of hijacking an engaged Web session with a remote service by intercepting and using the credentials that identified the user/victim to that specific server. Typically, SideJacking is most common on sites that require authentication through a username and password, such as online Web mail accounts as well as social networking sites. SideJacking works only if the site catches a non-SSL cookie, so any Web site that uses SSL exclusively would be safe from SideJackers. SideJacking was first demonstrated by Robert Graham, CEO of Errata Security at Black Hat in 2007.

sideloading
Sideloading involves installing and running applications on mobile devices that haven't been authorized or approved by the device's official app store. In the case of iOS mobile devices like the iPhone and iPad, users typically need to first jailbreak their device in order to sideload applications that aren't authorized and available through the official Apple App Store.
For Android devices, while users can root their device to sideload applications without going through the official Google Play market, the mobile OS also offers a quicker and potentially safer method for sideloading. Instead of rooting the Android device, users can opt to simply check a box in Application settings to "Allow installation of non-Market applications."
Security Concerns with Sideloading Applications
While Sideloading can give users access to applications that provide additional capabilities and features than they would otherwise have access to, there are security and stability concerns with sideloading mobile applications.

SIEM
Short for Security Incident and Event Manager SIEM is a set of tools used by IT professionals and system administrators to manage multiple security  applications and devices, and to respond automatically to resolve security incidents.

SIG
Acronym for special interest group, a group of users interested in a particular subject who discuss the subject at meetings or via an online service. SIGs exist for almost every conceivable subject. Online SIGs are sometimes called forums or conferences.   

SIGCOMM
Also known as ACM SIGCOMM, it is the professional discussion forum for the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). The SIGCOMM community consists of professional members representing scientists, engineers, educators and students. SIGCOMM facilitates discussion related to systems engineering and architectural questions as related to computer communications. SIGCOMM offers members conferences, workshops, online publications, awards, and other community resources.

sign
A symbol that identifies a number as being either positive or negative. A positive sign is +; a negative sign is -. These two signs are also used to indicate addition and subtraction, respectively. 

silicon
A nonmetallic chemical element in the carbon family of elements. Silicon - atomic symbol "Si" - is the second most abundant element in the earth's crust, surpassed only by oxygen. Silicon does not occur uncombined in nature. Sand and almost all rocks contain silicon combined with oxygen, forming silica. When silicon combines with other elements, such as iron, aluminum or potassium, a silicate is formed. Compounds of silicon also occur in the atmosphere, natural waters, many plants and in the bodies of some animals.  Silicon is the basic material used to make computer chips, transistors, silicon diodes and other electronic circuits and switching devices because its atomic structure makes the element an ideal semiconductor. Silicon is commonly doped, or mixed, with other elements, such as boron, phosphorous and arsenic, to alter its conductive properties.  Silicon was first isolated and described as an element in 1824 by J��ns Jacob Berzelius, a Swedish chemist.

Silicon_Valley
A nickname for the region south of San Francisco that contains an unusually high concentration of computer companies. Silicon is the most common semiconductor material used to produce chips.   

silk-road
Silk Road is the name of an online anonymous marketplace — or black market — website that trafficked illegal goods including drugs, guns, personal data and malware.
To operate, Silk Road ran on Tor (also see "onion routing"), an Internet network that is designed to make it nearly impossible to locate the computers that are used to host or access websites on the network. The Tor network takes a random pathway through several servers that cover your tracks so no observer at any single point can tell where the data came from or where it's going. This allowed Silk Road users to browse the website anonymously without fear of being tracked or monitored.
The Silk Road URL
The Silk Road URL directed users to a username and password screen. After providing a username and password to sign up, users would then be redirected to a site which has been compared to an illegal version of Amazon.com. Purchases were made using Bitcoin virtual currency. The URL to access Silk Road (and Silk Road 2.0) changes. Many online user groups and forums will post the Silk Road URL, which would require users to have the Tor Browser installed to work. 

silver_satin
A type of cable used for plugging in a telephone. Silver satin is the name given to the wiring where pairs of wires run side-by-side.

Silverlight
A Web-based digital video technology by Microsoft, codename "WPF/E".  Silverlight is a cross-browser, cross-platform plug-in for delivering media and rich interactive applications for the Web. The Silverlight browser plug-in is freely available for all major browsers including Mozilla Firefox, Apple'a Safari and Windows Internet Explorer running on the Macintosh or  Microsoft Windows. It's a competitor product to both the Adobe Macromedia Flash player and Apple QuickTime player. Silverlight is based on the Microsoft .NET Framework and can be integrated with existing Web infrastructure and applications, including Apache and PHP, JavaScript and XHTML on the client. Using Silverlight, designers are able to prepare media for encoding and distribution, and create W3C standards-compliant sites.

SIM
SIM is short for security information management. It is a type of software that automates the collection of event log data from security devices, such as such as firewalls, proxy servers, intrusion-detection systems and antivirus software. The SIM translates the logged data into correlated and simplified formats. Many SIM architecture provides security reporting, analysis and reporting for Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA, Basel II, FISMA and Visa CISP compliance audits.
SIM is also called security event management (SEM).

SIMD
Short for single instruction, multiple data. A type of parallel computing architecture that is classified under Flynn's taxonomy. A single computer instruction perform the same identical action (retrieve, calculate, or store) simultaneously on two or more pieces of data (Charles Belov, 1997). * Typically this consists of many simple processors, each with a local  memory in which it keeps the data which it will work on. Each processor simultaneously performs the same instruction on its local data progressing through the instructions in lock-step, with the instructions issued by the controller processor. The processors can communicate with each other in order to perform shifts and other array operations. [* Source: EPCC] See also Flynn's taxonomy.

SIMM
)Acronym for single in-line memory module, a small circuit board that can hold a group of memory chips. Typically, SIMMs hold up to eight (on Macintoshes) or nine (on PCs) RAM chips. On PCs, the ninth chip is often used for parity error checking. Unlike memory chips, SIMMs are measured in bytes rather than bits. SIMMs are easier to install than individual memory chips.  The bus from a SIMM to the actual memory chips is 32 bits wide. A newer technology, called dual in-line memory module (DIMM), provides a 64-bit bus. For modern Pentium microprocessors that have a 64-bit bus, you must use either DIMMs or pairs of SIMMs. 

SIMPLE
Short for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions, an application of the SIP protocol for server-to-server and client-to-server interoperability in instant messaging. SIMPLE is a step in bringing standardization to instant messaging.

Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer

Simple_HTML_Ontology_Extension
 
See SHOE.

simplex
Refers to transmission in only one direction. Note the difference between simplex and half-duplex. Half-duplex refers to two-way communications where only one party can transmit at a time. Simplex refers to one-way communications where one party is the transmitter and the other is the receiver. An example of simplex communications is a simple radio, which you can receive data from stations but can't transmit data. 

SIMSCRIPT
A high level programming language designed specifically for use in  simulation environments for building large scale simulation and modeling applications. The syntax of SIMSCRIPT is English-like allowing for long identifiers, and the capability for users to tailor the appearance of the source code. SIMSCRIPT was first produced by Harry Markowitz of Rand Corp in 1963.

simulation
The process of imitating a real phenomenon with a set of mathematical formulas. Advanced computer  programs can simulate weather conditions, chemical reactions, atomic reactions, even biological processes. In theory, any phenomena that can be reduced to mathematical data and equations can be simulated on a computer. In practice, however, simulation is extremely difficult because most natural phenomena are subject to an almost infinite number of influences. One of the tricks to developing useful simulations, therefore, is to determine which are the most important factors.  In addition to imitating processes to see how they behave under different conditions, simulations are also used to test new theories. After creating a theory of causal relationships, the theorist can codify the relationships in the form of a computer program. If the program then behaves in the same way as the real process, there is a good chance that the proposed relationships are correct. 

simultaneous_multithreading
Abbreviated as SMT, simultaneous multithreading is a processor design technology that allows multiple threads to issue instructions each cycle. Simultaneous multithreading enables multithreaded applications to execute threads in parallel on a single multi-core processor instead of processing threads in a linear fashion.See also Hyper-Threading.

single_electron_transistor
The single electron transistor or SET is type of switching device that uses controlled electron tunneling to amplify current. A SET is made from two tunnel junctions that share a common electrode. A tunnel junction consists of two pieces of metal separated by a very thin (~1 nm) insulator. The only way for electrons in one of the metal electrodes to travel to the other electrode is to tunnel through the insulator. Since tunneling is a discrete process, the electric charge that flows through the tunnel junction flows in multiples of e, the charge of a single electron.

single-pane-of-glass
Also referred to as single pane view, single pane of glass is an information technology (IT) phrase used to describe a management tool — such as a unified console or dashboard — that integrates information from varied sources across multiple applications and environments into a single display.
Single Pane in the Data Center
In the data center, a single pane view provides management with visibility into key IT performance indicators and metrics to align business goals and to link operational metrics with business priorities. To obtain a single pane view, key metrics must be captured across the different sources.
Some metrics are often provided by the application vendors offering APIs to access the key metrics. Industry best practice guides typically recommends compliance with the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) metrics and key performance indicators to ensure that the process is effective and efficient.

Single_SideBand_modulation
Abbreviated as SSB, Single SideBand modulation is a type modulation that eliminates all components of one sideband from an amplitude-modulated wave. SSB was used for long distance telephone communications. It consisted of groups of telephone conversations modulated on upper and/or lower sidebands of contiguous suppressed carriers. SSB was also used by the U.S. Air force for communications between nuclear bombers and NORAD, before satellite communications.

single_sign_on
See single signon.

single_signon
An authentication process in a client/server relationship where the user, or client, can enter one name and password and have access to more than one application or access to a number of resources within an enterprise. Single signon takes away the need for the user to enter further authentications when switching from one application to another.  Single signon is also spelled single sign on or single sign-on and abbreviated as SSO.

single_chip_projector
Projectors using a single-chip produce color by spinning a wheel that contains red, green, blue and clear sections. This color wheel spins between the lamp and Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) to produce a composite full-color image. Contrast with three-chip projector which uses three DMDs.

single_density_disk
A low-density floppy disk. All modern floppies are double-density or high-density. 

single_sided_disk

single_system_image
Abbreviated SSI. A form of distributed computing in which by using a common interface multiple networks, distributed databases or servers appear to the user as one system. In other words, the operating system environment is shared by all nodes in the system.

single_user_interface
1) An operating system that is usable by only one user at a time.2) An application that provides single interface from which a user can access multiple applications. For example, a social networking application that integrates multiple social platforms that can be used and accessed from a single interface.
Contrast with multi-user interface. See also user interface.

singlemode_fiber
In fiber optics technology singlemode fiber is one of two types of fiber currently in use. It is a single strand of glass fiber for a single ray (or mode) of light transmission. Singlemode fiber is used for long distance transmission. Compare with multimode fiber.

SIOC
(pronounced "shock") Short for Semantically Interlinked Online Communities SIOC is a project that proposes a method for interconnecting blogs, forums and mailing lists to each other on the Semantic Web.  SIOC started with the development of the SIOC core ontology, which is used to describe the domain of online communities and what they consist of  users and posts and descriptions of other simple terms that occur in online communities. This structure that is created in online communities is often hidden in some database behind the scenes, and SIOC is used to expose that structure using semantics.   See "SIOC-ing the Semantic Web" on SemanticWeb.com. See also "What Is The Semantic Web?" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. 

SIP
(1) Short for Session Initiation Protocol, it is an application-layer control protocol; a signaling protocol for Internet Telephony. SIP can establish sessions for features such as audio/videoconferencing, interactive gaming, and call forwarding to be deployed over IP networks, thus enabling service providers to integrate basic IP telephony services with Web, e-mail, and chat services. In addition to user authentication, redirect and registration services, SIP Server supports traditional telephony features such as personal mobility, time-of-day routing and call forwarding based on the geographical location of the person being called.
See "The Difference Between VoIP and PSTN Systems" in the Did You Know... section of Webopedia.
(2) Short for single in-line package, a type of housing for electronic components in which the connecting pins protrude from one side. Compare with DIP and PGA.

SIP_B
Short for session initiation protocol for business (SIP for Business) is a SIP-based protocol which allows advanced SIP features to be adopted for business telephony networks. SIP for Business does not modify the SIP standard in any way (nor does it propose any extensions or modifications to the SIP standard). It is a series of standard SIP-based call flows. The SIP-B initiative was developed by Sylantro Systems in consultation with Siemens, Polycom and Citel Technologies. See also SIP.

SIP_proxy
Also called a SIP server or SIP proxy server, in telecommunications it is one of the main components of an IP PBX that is used by SIP to perform many of the call set-up functions.  As described in RFC 3621 - SIP: Session Initiation Protocol SIP makes use of elements, called proxy servers (SIP proxy) "to route requests to the user's current location, authenticate and authorize users for services, implement provider call-routing policies, and provide features to users".  Within the SIP network the SIP proxy actually manages the setup of calls between SIP devices including the controlling of call routing and it also performs necessary functions such as registration, authorization, network access control and in some cases it also handles network security. See Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). See also "Understanding SIP Part V: SIP Signaling" on  Enterprise VoIP Planet. Also see "VoIP and the Small Business" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. Also see "Internet Telephony" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

siphoning
In SEO, siphoning is a technique used to "steal" traffic that would normally be directed to another website in search engine results. Siphoning could be the fraudulent use of spyware or cybersquatting to steal the traffic, or it could refer to those who copy a webpage with the content slightly altered to direct the Web search engine to show results of another webpage.

SIPphone
Based on SIP (Session Initiated Protocol) a SIPphone is a SIP service that provides a free SIP-based VoIP network. To use SIPphone you need either a SIPphone adapter or softphone software and a broadband Internet connection.  To make free in-network (SIP to SIP) calls, both sides of the call must have a SIPphone adapter or softphone. To make inexpensive calls to non-SIPphones (PSTN), you will need SIP minutes.

siri
Siri is a built-in "intelligent assistant" that enables users of Apple iPhone 4S and later and newer iPad and iPod Touch devices to speak natural language voice commands in order to operate the mobile device and its apps. Users can speak commands -- and receive audible confirmation from Siri -- to send messages, place calls, set reminders, operate iTunes and more.
Siri can work across multiple iPhone and iPad apps as needed in order to accomplish its tasks. Siri also supports extended dictation, enabling users to have their words translated into text for use in e-mail and text messages, Facebook status updates, tweets, note-taking Web searching and similar operations.
Siri also features prominently in the Siri Eyes Free and iOS in the Car technologies from Apple that provide voice command support of a car's audio system or in-vehicle infotainment system.

siri_eyes_free
An extension of Apple's Siri functionality for enabling voice control of an iOS mobile device that is linked with a car's in-dash audio system.

SISD
Short for single instruction, single data. A type of parallel computing architecture that is classified under Flynn's taxonomy. A single processor executes a single instruction stream, to operate on data stored in a single memory. There is often a central controller that broadcasts the instruction stream to all the processing elements. See also Flynn's taxonomy.

site
A site (location) on the World Wide Web. Each Web site contains a home page, which is the first document users see when they enter the site. The site might also contain additional documents and files. Each site is owned and managed by an individual, company or organization.


site_license
A type of software licensing agreement that grants the purchaser permission to use the  software on a network on a single site, with an unlimited number of end users. Usually this type of license allows you to copy and use the software on multiple computers at one site and is more expensive than purchasing a single copy but less expensive than purchasing a copy for each computer at the site. There may be a maximum specified number of simultaneous end users.  See also EULA.

site_map
A hierarchical visual model of the pages of a Web site. Site maps help users navigate through a Web site that has more than one page by showing the user a diagram of the entire site's contents. Similar to a book's table of contents, the site map makes it easier for a user to find information on a site without having to navigate through the site's many pages. Also, in SEO, a site map can make it easier for a search engine spider to find all a site's pages.

sitewide
In SEO (search engine optimization) terminology, sitewide refers to the linking and navigation structure that is deployed across an entire Web site. May also be seen written as site-wide.

Six_Sigma
A data-driven management philosophy developed by Motorola for eliminating defects, waste and quality-control problems in manufacturing. The basic idea behind Six Sigma is that if one can measure the amount of "defects" in a process, one can systematically determine how to eliminate them, getting as close to zero defects (i.e., perfection) as possible. In order to achieve Six Sigma, the process cannot produce more than 3.4 defects per million opportunities (opportunity being defined as a chance for nonconformance or not meeting the required expectations).  Six Sigma is broken down into two different processes: Six Sigma DMADV -- a process that defines, measures, analyzes, designs and verifies new processes or products that are trying to achieve Six Sigma quality. Six Sigma DMAIC -- a process that defines, measures, analyzes, improves and controls existing processes that fall below the Six Sigma specification. Six Sigma processes are carried out by professionals deemed by Motorola as either Six Sigma Green Belts or Six Sigma Black Belts, the Black Belts having more expertise in the Six Sigma process.  The term is derived from the Greek letter sigma, a mathematical term that represents a measure of variation.  According to Motorola, Six Sigma has had non-manufacturing applications in transactional processes, such as billing and customer support.

size
To make an object larger or smaller. In graphical user interfaces, you can size windows to make them larger or smaller.  Other terms for size are resize and scale.   

size_on_disk
Files are stored on the disk in what is called called clusters (a group of disk  sectors). Size on disk refers to the amount of cluster allocation a file is taking up, compared to file size which is an actual byte count. The lowest cluster size for FAT32 is 1, so if the actual file only needs a small portion of the cluster, the size on disk for that file will reflect the entire cluster as being used. This is why when you check the properties tab of a file (using  Microsoft Windows), you will usually see the size on disk size is larger than the file size. See also cluster and file.

skin
An element of a graphical user interface that can be changed to alter the look of the interface without affecting its functionality. Skins can give an interface an entirely different look than what it originally came with.  Skins are often used to change the look and feel of a Web browser, altering the appearance and/or location of buttons, providing background images or borders that did not originally come with the browser, changing the colors and/or other graphic elements, or even changing the shape of the browser window.  There are many browser skins available for free online; however, users should be aware that skins sometimes come with additional predetermined buttons in the toolbar that did not come with the original browser software. Organizations use these elements to advertise and/or track the Internet activity of the user.

SKU
Short for stock keeping unit, SKU is a unique numerical identifying number that refers to a specific stock item in a retailer's inventory or product catalog. The SKU is often used to identify the product, product size or type, and the manufacturer. In the retail industry, the SKU is a part of the backend inventory control system and enables a retailer to track a product in their inventory that may be in warehouses or in retail outlets.
See also UPC.


Skulls
A type of cellphone virus that deactivates all links to your cellphone applications, including e-mail, IM, and calendar. It replaces all  icons on your cellphone with images of skulls.

skunkworks
Skunkworks or skunkworks project is a slang phrase commonly used in business and technology to describe a small and loosely structured group of people who research and develop a project for the sake of innovation in technology.
A skunkworks project often operates independent of a company's normal research and development operations and therefore is subject to limitations in resources. Projects often are undertaken in secret with the understanding that if the development is successful then the product will be designed later according to the usual process.
Famous Skunkworks Projects
Many companies use skunkworks projects to develop innovative, technological advancements. Famous examples of a skunkworks projects include the following:

skydrive
SkyDrive is a personal cloud storage service from Microsoft that enables customers to store, synchronize and access their files across Windows PC and Mac OS X computers and laptops as well as mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, including Windows Phone 7 and 8 devices and Apple iOS-powered iPhones and iPads.
Syncing Files and Documents on SkyDrive
SkyDrive is most frequently used for syncing documents and files created with Microsoft products like Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. SkyDrive additionally enables users to remotely access their PC (as long as the computer is turned on) via SkyDrive.com and a SkyDrive desktop client.    SkyDrive will also be a critical component of the upcoming Office 2013 release, with the new office suite saving documents directly to SkyDrive by default, enabling users to access their Office files across a variety of devices.   Users will also have the option of saving their documents locally or offline and then have them sync with SkyDrive upon going online again.
Competing Personal Cloud Services
While competing personal cloud services from Apple (iCloud) and Google (Google Drive) provide users with an initial 5GB of cloud storage for free, SkyDrive offers up to 7GB of cloud storage for free.  Additional storage capacity is available for purchase on a yearly basis -- currently 20GB for $10 per year, 50GB for $25 per year and 100GB for $50 per year.

Skype
Skype is a computer program that can be used to make free voice calls over the Internet to anyone else who is also using Skype. It's free and considered easy to download and use, and works with most computers. Once you download, register and install the software, you'll need to plug in a headset, speakers or USB phone to start using Skype. On September 12, 2005 Skype was acquired by eBay.  See also Internet telephony.

skype_worm
The Skype worm is a strain of the Dorkbot family of malware that made headlines in October 2012.  The Skype worm sends a message like “LOL, is this your new profile pic?” from an infected Skype user’s contact list, attempting to entice fellow Skype users into clicking on the link and downloading and installing the Skype worm.  As with other forms of Dorkbot, the Skype worm opens a backdoor on infected computers, allowing for remote access. The Skype worm also installs a form of ransomware, wherein the malware threatens to lock a user out of being able to use their computer and demands a payment of several hundreds of dollars within a limited time frame or have their files deleted.

Computers infected with the Skye worm may also receive a ransomware message claiming that the computer has been used for illegal activity and that the user will be reported to federal authorities unless a payment is made within a limited timeframe.

skyscraper_ad
An online banner, image or media ad that is taller than the standard 120x240 pixel vertical banner ad.

skywiper
An extremely sophisticated strain of malware more commonly referred to as Flame (or Flamer), although some security experts classify the two differently.  Skywiper, or sKyWIper, is one of the largest and most complex malware strains to date, with a total size of more than 30MB when its 20+ modules and plug-ins have been installed.    Skywiper has the ability to record extensive system information on an infected machine, and also has keystroke monitoring and packet sniffing functionality as well as backdoor capabilities that enable cyber attackers to trigger, update or erase the malware on command.  The Skywiper malware had been in circulation for at least two years prior to being detected, primarily targeting countries in the Middle East, and Skywiper is believed to have been created and conducted with "nation-state support" due to its high level of complexity and targeted area of focus.

SLA
Abbreviated SLA, a contract between an ASP and the end user which stipulates and commits the ASP to a required level of service. An SLA should contain a specified level of service, support options, enforcement or penalty provisions for services not provided, a guaranteed level of system performance as relates to downtime or uptime, a specified level of customer support and what software or hardware will be provided and for what fee.

slack_space
The unused space in a disk cluster. The DOS and Windows file systems use fixed-size clusters. Even if the actual data being stored requires less storage than the cluster size, an entire cluster is reserved for the file. The unused space is called the slack space.  DOS and older Windows systems use a 16-bit file allocation table (FAT), which results in very large cluster sizes for large partitions. For example, if the partition size is 2 GB, each cluster will be 32 K. Even if a file requires only 4 K, the entire 32 K will be allocated, resulting in 28 K of slack space. Windows 95 OSR 2 and Windows 98 resolve this problem by using a 32-bit FAT (FAT32) that supports cluster sizes smaller than 1K. 

slacker
An Internet radio service that competes with similar offerings like Pandora.  Whereas Pandora uses the Music Genome Project for selecting music that matches a listener’s preferences, Slacker utilizes the combined knowledge of music experts to hand-pick songs based on the listener’s personal preferences.  The service has also recently branched out to offer news content and sports content from the likes of ABC and ESPN, respectively. 
Slacker offers three subscription plans for its listeners:  a free, advertisement-supported plan, a Slacker Radio Plus plan and a Slacker Radio Premium plan that adds additional features like the ability to create customized playlists and play specific songs on demand.  All subscribers have access to more than 100 professionally pre-programmed radio stations as well as 10,000+ artist stations. 
Slacker is available over the Web as well as via portable devices like the Slacker G2 Personal Radio Player and mobile devices such as Apple’s iPhone and iPod touch, Android-powered devices, and BlackBerry, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone 7 smartphones.

Slang term used to describe a link that has been posted on slashdot.org. Links posted on Slashdot typically drive a large amount of traffic to your blog or Web site.

slate_PC
A class of notebook computer that accepts input from an electronic pen rather than from a keyboard. Slate PCs are particularly useful in situations where keyboards are awkward or unnecessary. Typically, slate PCs can decipher clearly written block letters and translate them into their ASCII equivalents. To date, however, they cannot handle script, although the technology of handwriting recognition is progressing rapidly. 

slave
Any device that is controlled by another device, called the master. 

SLC
Short for single-level cell SLC is a type of NAND flash memory that is commonly found in high performance USB memory cards. SLC works by storing one bit in each cell that offers lower-power consumption and faster transfer speeds when compared to  multi-level cell (MLC) cards. See also "Different Types of Memory Cards" in the "Did You Know...?" section of Webopedia.

SLDRAM
Short for Synchronous Link DRAM, a type of memory being developed by the now defunct SyncLink Consortium. SLDRAM was intended to be an enhanced version of SDRAM that used a multiplexed bus to transfer data to and from chips rather than fixed pin settings. It was meant to compete with RDRAM as a future PC memory architecture but never gained widespread acceptance.  

sleekbook
A marketing term developed by Hewlett-Packard to refer to AMD-powered ultraportable laptops that fit between Intel's ultrabook designation and the more traditional notebook or laptop.  While HP's sleekbooks share many similarities with ultrabooks, the company created the sleekbook name to give it more leeway in creating new thin and light notebook computers that don't meet all of Intel's restrictive specifications for ultrabooks. 
The most noticeable difference between ultrabooks and sleekbooks is that sleekbook models utilize AMD processors instead of Intel's Sandy Bridge and newer Ivy Bridge processors.  HP's Envy Sleekbooks also cost less than their HP Envy Ultrabook counterparts, and while they tend to be a bit thicker and heavier, sleekbooks do offer larger screens at 14" and 15.6" than the typical 13" screen size of an ultrabook.

sleep_mode
An energy-saving mode of operation in which all unnecessary components are shut down. Many battery-operated devices, such as notebook computers, support a sleep mode. When a notebook computer goes into sleep mode, it shuts down the display screen and disk drive. Once awakened, the computer returns to its former operating status.   

SLI
Acronym for Scalable Link Interface
NVIDIA SLI (Scalable Link Interface)technology links two graphics cards together to provide scalability and increased performance. NVIDIA SLI takes advantage of the increased bandwidth of the PCI Express bus architecture, and features hardware and software innovations within NVIDIA GPUs (graphics processing units) and NVIDIA MCPs (media and communications processors). Depending on the application, NVIDIA SLI can deliver as much as two times the performance of a single GPU configuration.

slice
In low-speed communications networking a slice is a subdivision of a channel buffer. Sections of the buffer are divided into slices that are used for buffering network messages and data.

slide
A slide or slider phone is a mobile phone form factor where the phone is designed like a clamshell phone, in that each half of the phone is dividing the display and speaker from the keyboard buttons. However, rather than the halves being hinged to open and close, the two halves slide open. On a slide phone the main display screen can be viewed when the phone is in the closed position.  Examples of slide mobile phones include the Nokia 6600, the T-Mobile Sidekick Slide, and the Samsung D900 Slide Phone. See also "The Difference Between a Cell Phone, Smartphone and PDA" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia.  

sliding_window
(n.) Also referred to as windowing, a method of flow control for transferring data over networks. TCP sends data across a network in packets and requires the receiving device to send an acknowledgement, or ACK, when it successfully has received the packet, which signals the sending device that another packet can be sent. Window size is the number of data packets that can be sent without waiting for an ACK. With the sliding window method, the receiving device can send a single acknowledgement message for multiple packets of data sent in one window. Within that acknowledgement message is information about the receiving device��s buffer size, which tells the sending device to increase or decrease the number of packets in the next transmission (this is where the "sliding" in the name comes in). If the application reading the data processes the packets at a slower rate than the sending device is transmitting them, it will tell the sending device to decrease the number of packets or temporarily cease transmission altogether, in order to free up room in the buffer; if the receiving application can process the packets faster than the sending device is transmitting them, it will tell the sending device to increase the number of packets in the next window as the application��s buffer can handle more data.

slimeware
A slang term used to describe software that interferes with the user experience by changing key settings in order to gain profit. A type of adware.Also see The Difference Between Adware & Spyware in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia. 

slimline_model
A small desktop model computer. See under desktop model computer. 

Slingbox
A Slingbox is a compact electronic device that connects to the back of your TV. It redirects or "placeshifts" the TV signal from your cable box, satellite receiver, or digital video recorder (DVR) to your computer or laptop, so long as you have a high-speed Internet connection. If you use the Slingbox in conjunction with a broadband Internet connection, the viewer's live TV stream can be placeshifted via the Internet to a PC located anywhere in the world. Slingbox is a registered trademark of Sling Media Inc.

SLIP
Short for Serial Line Internet Protocol, a protocol for connection to the Internet via a dial-up connection. Developed in the 80s when modem communications typically were limited to 2400 bps, it was designed for simple communication over serial lines. SLIP can be used on RS-232 serial ports and supports asynchronous links.  A more common protocol is PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) because it is faster and more reliable and supports functions that SLIP does not, such as error detection, dynamic assignment of IP addresses and data compression.  In general, Internet service providers offer only one protocol although some support both protocols.

slipstream
(v.) To add enhancements to or fix bugs in software without creating a new version number to identify the changes.  (adj.) Refers to a fix or enhancement that was made to software without creating a new version number to identify the changes. The term is used, for example, to refer to a slipstream repair or a slipstream fix.  (n.) The software fix or enhancement itself, as in the slipstream introduced an important new feature.

SLOC
Short for Source Lines Of Code, it is a count of the number of lines of code contained in an application or system. There are various tools which help developers estimate the SLOC count, which is often used as a way to convey the size of a project to managers and other stakeholders.

slocket
Also called a slocket or a riser, a slotket is an adapter that accepts socket 370 CPUs into Slot 1 motherboards.   Computer owners can upgrade their systems with the newest CPUs, such as current and future Celerons and Pentiums, without having to replace their Slot 1 motherboards for the new 370s. 

slot
An opening in a computer where you can insert a printed circuit board. Slots are often called expansion slots because they allow you to expand the capabilities of a computer. The boards you insert in expansion slots are called expansion boards or add-on  boards.  Do not confuse slots with bays. Bays are sites within the computer where you can install disk drives. Typically, slots are in the back of the computer and bays are in the front. 

Slot_1
The form factor for Intel's Pentium II processors. The Slot 1 package replaces the Socket 7 and Socket 8 form factors used by previous Pentium processors. Slot 1 is a 242-contact daughtercard slot that accepts a microprocessor packaged as a Single Edge Contact (SEC) cartridge. A motherboard can have one or two Slot 1s. 

Slot_2
A chip packaging design used in Intel's newer Pentium II chipsets, starting with the Xeon CPU. While the Slot 1 interface features a 242-contact connector, Slot 2 uses a somewhat wider 330-contact connector. The biggest difference between Slot 1 and Slot 2, though, is that the Slot 2 design allows the CPU to communicate with the L2 cache at the CPU's full clock speed. In contrast, Slot 1 only supports communication between the L2 cache and CPU at half the CPU's clock speed. 

slotket
Also called a slocket or a riser, a slotket is an adapter that accepts socket 370 CPUs into Slot 1 motherboards.   Computer owners can upgrade their systems with the newest CPUs, such as current and future Celerons and Pentiums, without having to replace their Slot 1 motherboards for the new 370s. 

SLP
Short for Service Location Protocol (SLP) was originally an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards track protocol that provides a framework to allow networking applications to discover the existence, location, and configuration of networked services in enterprise networks. Traditionally, in order to locate services on the network, users of network applications have been required to supply the host name or network address of the machine that provides a desired service. SLP can eliminate the need for users to know the names of network hosts. With SLP, the user only needs to know the description of the service he is interested in.

SLR
Short for single lens reflex, is a term associated with cameras and digital cameras. SLR cameras use a mirror between the lens and the film, or image sensor, to provide a focus screen. This means the image you see in the viewfinder (or LCD) will be the same as what appears on film or as your digital image.
See also "The Digital Camera Picture" in Webopedia's Quick Reference section.

small_business
A small business is a privately owned and operated business. A small business typically has a small number of employees. In the United States, the legal definition of a small business is determined by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), which sets the criteria to be used by the SBA in making small business determinations.
Criteria by the SBA in determining the definition of a small business includes the number of workers employed or annual receipts. The following criteria is used by the SBA to define a small business:


Manufacturing: Maximum number of employees may range from 500 to 1500
Wholesaling: Maximum number of employees may range from 100 to 500
Services: Annual receipts may not exceed $2.5 to $21.5 million
Retailing: Annual receipts may not exceed $5.0 to $21.0 million
General and Heavy Construction: Annual receipts may not exceed $13.5 to $17 million
Special Trade Construction: Annual receipts may not exceed $7 million
Agriculture: Annual receipts may not exceed $0.5 to $9.0 million [Source:  SBA's definition of a small business concern]



small_business_crm
In CRM (customer relationship management) terminology, the phrase small business CRM is used to describe a lightweight CRM application that is designed to meet the needs of a small business.
Customer relationship management solutions provide you with the customer business data to help you provide services or products that your customers want, provide better customer service, cross-sell and up sell more effectively, close deals, retain current customers and understand who the customer is.
Recommended Reading: Webopedia's CRM software definition.
While the phrase customer relationship management is most commonly used to describe a business-customer relationship, CRM systems are used in the same way to manage business contacts, clients, contract wins and sales leads. 
The Difference Between Enterprise and Small Business CRM


small_business_erp
In ERP (enterprise resource planning) terminology, the phrase small business ERP is used to describe a lightweight business management software that is designed to meet the needs of a small business.
ERP software integrates all facets of an operation, including development, manufacturing, sales and marketing. Small business ERP is typically a SaaS (software as a service) model and includes project management, financials, manufacturing, warehouse management, accounting, sales and business management.
Typically, ERP software is considered an enterprise application and designed for larger enterprises that require dedicated teams to customize, analyze the data and reports and handle upgrades and deployment. In contrast, Small business ERP applications differ in a number of ways including the amount of data handled by the system and less-complex screens and dashboards. Support is offered by the provider and the software is customized for the business industry you work in.

small_business_phone_system
A small business phone system comprises multiple telephones used in an interconnected fashion that allows for advanced telephony features such as call handling and transferring, conference calling, call metering and accounting, private and shared voice message boxes, and so on.  A small office phone system can range from just a few telephones to a private branch exchange (PBX) system.
Small business phone systems can function over the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), over the Internet (Internet telephony or VoIP), or over a combination of the two.  A small office phone system can also be delivered as a hosted service (typically referred to as a centrex), which can free small businesses from having to invest in costly equipment.
See   The Difference Between VoIP and PSTN Systems in the   Did You Know... section of Webopedia.Also see the   VoIP Meets WiFi article in the   Did You Know? section of Webopedia. 

small_business_server
A small business server is typically a low-end server designed to be affordable and manageable in a small business environment. Small Business servers are suitable for one to dozens of employees and may come pre-installed with the software needed to run the server.
A small business one server is often used to manage multiple network services including email, threat management, Internet connectivity, file and printer sharing, remote access and data backups.
Small business servers differ from servers used in large corporations and data centers, which are often dedicated to perform a primary task. Multiple dedicated servers (such as print servers, Web servers or database servers) perform no other function apart from their designated task.

SCSI
The Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) is a set of parallel interface standards developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for attaching printers, disk drives, scanners and other peripherals to computers. SCSI (pronounced "skuzzy") is supported by all major operating systems.
The first version (SCSI-1), adopted by ANSI in 1986, was an 8-bit version with a 5 MBps transfer speed that allowed up to eight devices to be connected with a maximum cable length of six meters. The latest version, 16-bit Ultra-640 (Fast-320) SCSI, was introduced in 2003 and has a 640 MBps transfer speed, connecting up to 16 devices with a 12 meter cable length. Other versions include:
SCSI-2: 8-bit bus, six meter cable length, 5-10 MBps; connects 8 or 16 devices. 50-pin connector.


Smalltalk
An object-oriented operating system and programming language developed at Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center. Smalltalk was the first object-oriented programming language (Simula was the very first). Although it never achieved the commercial success of other languages such as C++ and Java, Smalltalk is considered by many to be the only true object-oriented programming environment, and the one against which all others must be compared.  

SMART
Acronym for Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology, an open standard for developing disk drives and software systems that automatically monitor a disk drive's health and report potential problems. Ideally, this should allow you to take proactive actions to prevent impending disk crashes. 

smart_card
A small electronic device about the size of a credit card that contains electronic memory, and possibly an embedded integrated circuit (IC). Smart cards containing an IC are sometimes called Integrated Circuit Cards (ICCs).  Smart cards are used for a variety of purposes, including:  Storing a patient's medical records Storing digital cash Generating network IDs (similar to a token)   To use a smart card, either to pull information from it or add data to it, you need a smart card reader, a small device into which you insert the smart card. 

smart_client
(smärt klī´&nt) (n.) An Internet-connected device that allows the user's local applications to interact with server-based applications through the use of Web services. For example, a smart client running a word processing application can interface with a remote database over the Internet in order to collect data from the database to be used in the word processing document. Smart clients are distinguished by key characteristics:  They support work offline �� smart clients can work with data even when they are not connected to the Internet (which distinguishes them from browser-based applications, which do not work when the device is not connected to the Internet); Smart client applications have the ability to be deployed and updated in real time over the network from a centralized server; Smart client applications support multiple platforms and languages because they are built on Web services; Smart client applications can run on almost any device that has Internet connectivity, including desktops, workstations, notebooks, tablet PCs, PDAs, and mobile phones. 

smart_dust
Millimeter-scale self-contained microelectromechanical devices that include sensors, computational ability, bi-directional wireless communications technology and a power supply.  As tiny as dust particles, smart dust motes can be spread throughout buildings or into the atmosphere to collect and monitor data. Smart dust devices have applications in everything from military to meteorological to medical fields.

smart_grid
A type of power grid that uses digital technology to deliver electricity to consumers. Using digital technology helps the grid to operate more efficiently and also helps consumers to save energy and costs while reliability of the grid is increased. Smart grids are considered to be "green technology" and are more environmentally friendly although often more prone to cyber attacks.

smart_terminal
A terminal that has some processing capabilities, but not as many as an intelligent terminal. Smart terminals have built-in logic for performing simple display operations, such as blinking and boldface. In contrast, a dumb terminal has no processing capabilities at all.   

smart_tv
Televisions that integrate the Internet and Web 2.0 features to provide a more interactive experience for users.  Also known as connected TVs, Smart TVs provide features like Web browsing; video-on-demand and video streaming via services such as YouTube, Netflix and Hulu Plus; Internet radio from services like Pandora and Rhapsody; social networking from sites like Twitter and Facebook; apps and games and more.  Smart TVs are also typically DLNA certified, enabling the sharing of movies, photos, music and similar multimedia content from other DLNA-compliant PCs, tablet computers, smartphones and similar devices.
While a number of television manufacturers are now selling Smart TVs, consumers with traditional TVs can receive Smart TV capabilities on their existing TVs via Smart TV-capable Blu-ray players and set-top boxes.  Other examples of Smart TVs include Google TV, Ubuntu TV and LG Smart TV.

Smartdrive
A disk caching system provided by Microsoft with later versions of DOS and used with Windows 3.1. Disk caching provides faster access to data on a hard disk. Smartdrive allows you to monitor how the cache is used and change the cache size to optimize performance.  Starting with Windows 95, Smartdrive was replaced by a disk caching system called VCACHE.  

SmartLinks
In Semantic Web terminology, SmartLinks point to things, where regular links point to pages. SmartLinks pulls in the best information from around the Web, right into the user's context. For example, instead of interacting with the pointer to a book, with SmartLink, the user is interacting with the actual book.  Also see "Add Context with SmartLinks" on  SemanticWeb.com.

SmartMenu
In Web browsers, a SmartMenu is a set of context-sensitive shortcuts personalized based on the user's browsing history. Context-sensitive means that entries change depending on what the user is looking at. The personalization means that the sites in the shortcuts are specific to the user.   Also see "SmartMenu: Getting the Browser to Understand" on  SemanticWeb.com.

smartphone
Smartphones are a handheld device that integrates mobile phone capabilities with the more common features of a handheld computer or PDA. Smartphones allow users to store information, e-mail, install programs, along with using a mobile phone in one device. For example a Smartphone could be a mobile phone with some PDA functions integrated into the device, or vise versa.

smartwatch
A wearable computing device worn on a user's wrist that offers functionality and capabilities similar to those of a smartphone. Smartwatches are designed to, either on their own or when paired with a smartphone, provide features like connecting to the internet, running mobile apps, making calls, messaging via text or video, checking caller ID, accessing stock and weather updates, providing fitness monitoring capabilities, offering GPS coordinates and location directions, and more.    A number of companies either currently have smart watches on the market or are rumored to be developing smartwatches, including Google, Samsung, Apple (the "iWatch"), LG, Sony, Pebble and various others.  While the smartwatch industry is still in its infancy, new and emerging technologies like Corning’s flexible Willow Glass, Bluetooth 4.0 and more power-efficient processors and displays are providing the potential for the development of more advanced, longer-lasting smartwatches than those currently available.

SMB
(1) Short for Server Message Block, a message format used by DOS and Windows to share files, directories and devices. NetBIOS is based on the SMB format, and many network products use SMB. These SMB-based networks include Lan Manager, Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT, and Lan Server. There are also a number of products that use SMB to enable file sharing among different operating system platforms. A product called Samba, for example, enables UNIX and Windows machines to share directories and files.
(2) Short for small-to-midsize business, or small-medium business.

SMBus
The System Management Bus (SMBus) is a two-wire interface through which simple power-related chips can communicate with rest of the system. It uses I2C as its backbone. With the SMBus, a device can provide manufacturer information, tell the system what its model or part number is, save its state for a suspend event, report different types of errors, accept control parameters and return its status.

SMDI
Pronounced smi-dee, an acronym for SCSI Musical Data Interchange. SMIDI is a data interchange standard originated in 1991 by Peavey Electronics that allows large amounts of musical data, such as digital audio files from a sampling keyboard, to be transferred over the SCSI at high speeds between products of different manufacturers. Compared to MIDI, SMDI is much faster. A large file that takes hours to transfer with MIDI can take minutes with SMDI.

SMDS
Short for Switched Multimegabit Data Services, a high-speed switched data communications service offered by telephone companies that enable organizations to connect geographically separate local-area networks (LANs) into a single wide-area network (WAN). Prior to SMDS's arrival in 1995, the only way to connect LANs was through a dedicated private line. This is still the way most WANs are connected, but SMDS is becoming an increasingly attractive alternative because it is more flexible and in many cases more economical. 

SMI_S
(pronounced as separate letters) Short for Storage Management Initiative Specification, an interface standard that enables interoperability in both hardware and software between storage products from different vendors that an enterprise would use in a SAN environment. The interface provides common protocols and data models that storage product vendors can use to ensure end user manageability of the SAN environment.  Based on the CIM and Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) standards, SMI-S adds common interoperable and extensible management transport, automated discovery, and resource locking functions.  SMI-S was developed by the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) in 2002.

SMIL
Short for Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language, a new markup language being developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that would enable Web developers to divide multimedia content into separate files and streams (audio, video, text, and images), send them to a user's computer individually, and then have them displayed together as if they were a single multimedia stream. The ability to separate out the static text and images should make the multimedia content much smaller so that it doesn't take as long to travel over the Internet.  SMIL is based on the eXtensible Markup Language (XML). Rather than defining the actual formats used to represent multimedia data, it defines the commands that specify whether the various multimedia components should be played together or in sequence. 

smiley
A smiley is often used in text communications to convey an emotion with a message. Smilies are used in  text messages in the same way voice changes and facial expressions are used in face-to-face or telephone conversation. For example, if you were joking with someone and send a text message of "Idiot!" the person receiving your message may think you are making a rude comment to them. If you send the same message with a "happy smiley" : ) following, the person would then understand you were "smiling" - or joking when you said that, and not misinterpret your intent.  To create a smiley you use your standard keyboard characters and punctuation marks. When viewing text smilies they are all sideways. Smilies are often used in online chat rooms, game rooms, instant messaging, and in e-mail. A smiley can also be called an emoticon. See also Text Messaging Abbreviations & Smilies in Webopedia's Quick Reference section.

SMiShing
A compound of 'phishing' and 'SMS'.  SMiShing (SMS phishing) is a type of phishing attack where mobile phone users receive text messages containing a Web site hyperlink, which, if clicked would download a Trojan horse to the mobile phone. The term SMiShing was coined by David Rayhawk in a McAfee Avert Labs blog on August 25, 2006. Also see the All About Phishing page in the "Did You Know? section of Webopedia for more information, including examples, of phishing. 

smishing_scams
Short for SMS Phishing, smishing is a variant of phishing email scams that instead utilizes Short Message Service (SMS) systems to send bogus text messages. Also written as SMiShing, SMS phishing made recent headlines when a vulnerability in the iPhone's SMS text messaging system was discovered that made smishing on the mobile device possible.  Smishing scams frequently seek to direct the text message recipient to visit a website or call a phone number, at which point the person being scammed is enticed to provide sensitive information such as credit card details or passwords. Smishing websites are also known to attempt to infect the person's computer with malware.

SmitFraud
The term SmitFraud is used to describe a type of spyware that tricks users into purchasing fake antispyware and antivirus programs.  SmitFraud is a Trojan that is most commonly distributed through fake codec downloads. When attempting to play a video, for example, a user may be warned that a codec, such as VideoKeyCodec or BrainCodec, is missing and then download it. The user is unaware that this is a hoax and the fake codec is carrying, and will install, a form of SmitFraud on the system.   Once installed the malware will start showing pop-ups indicating that the system is infected with viruses and spyware. These pop-ups will show an alarming number of infections and provide links to Web sites where users can purchase the antivirus program to remove these infections. The problem is that this malware is not showing real infections, and it is simply tricking victims into purchasing a fake antispyware or antivirus program. Users may not even have an infection on their system, other than the SmitFraud program itself that is warning you of serious, multiple infections.

SMLT
Split Multi-Link Trunking (SMLT) is an improvement over Multi-Link Trunking (MLT), a method of link aggregation that allows multiple Ethernet links to be aggregated together, and handled as a single logical trunk. SMLT is the splitting of member links in a normal MLT trunk from an end device across two devices. These devices synchronize state across an Inter-Switch Link (IST) such that they appear to the connecting device to be a single device (switch block) and prevent any packet duplication. SMLT provides enhanced resiliency with sub-second failover while operating transparently to end-devices. See also trunk.

social_media_optimization
Abbreviated as SMO, social media optimization is the process of increasing the awareness of a product, brand or event by using a number of social media outlets and communities to generate viral publicity.
Social media optimization includes using RSS feeds, social news and bookmarking sites, as well as social media sites and video and blogging sites. SMO is similar to SEO (search engine optimization) in that the goal is to drive traffic to your Web site.
See "Social Media Tips for Online Marketing Plus 30 Social Media Sites" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia.

smoke_testing
In software development, smoke testing is a slang term used by programmers in reference to hardware testing. When testing software in development, the joke is if it is tried on a new piece of hardware for the first time and it does not catch on fire, it is a successful test.

smoothing
A technique used by some printers to make curves look smoother. Most printers that support smoothing implement it by reducing the dot size of the dots that make up a curved line. In addition, some printers can alter the horizontal alignment of dots to minimize jaggies. 

SMP
(1) Short for Symmetric Multiprocessing, a computer architecture that provides fast performance by making multiple CPUs available to complete individual processes simultaneously (multiprocessing). Unlike asymmetrical processing, any idle processor can be assigned any task, and additional CPUs can be added to improve performance and handle increased loads. A variety of specialized operating systems and hardware arrangements are available to support SMP. Specific applications can benefit from SMP if the code allows multithreading.
SMP uses a single operating system and shares common memory and disk input/output resources. Both UNIX and Windows NT support SMP.
(2) Short for Simple Management Protocol, another name for SNMP2. SNMP2 is an enhanced version of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)with features required to support larger networks operating at high data transmission rates. SNMP2 also supports multiple network management workstations organized in a hierarchical fashion.

SMPTE
Short for The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, SMPTE is an international standards organization for the the motion imaging field. SMPTE publishes ANSI-approved Standards, Recommended Practices, and Engineering Guidelines, along with the SMPTE Journal and its peer-reviewed technical papers. SMPTE members include engineers, technical directors, cameramen, editors, technicians, manufacturers, designers, educators, consultants and field users in networking, compression and encryption.  The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) was founded in 1916.

SMS
(1) Short for Systems Management Server, a set of tools from Microsoft that assists in managing PCs connected to a local-area network (LAN). SMS enables a network administrator to create an inventory of all the hardware and software on the network and to store it in an SMS database. Using this database, SMS can then perform software distribution and installation over the LAN. SMS also enables a network administrator to perform diagnostic tests on PCs attached to the LAN.
SMS runs under Windows NT but can manage PCs running DOS, all varieties of Windows, and OS/2, as well as Macintosh clients.
(2) Short for Short Message Service Similar to paging, SMS is a service for sending short text messages to mobile phones.

SMS_gateway
An SMS gateway is placed between two SMSCs, acting as a relay between the two SMSCs. It is able to translate one SMSC protocol to another, and can be used by two different wireless carriers to interconnect their SMSCs.[Adapted from The SMS Tutorial] 

SMSC
Short for Short Message Service (SMS) Center. The SMS center is responsible for routing and regulating the SMS operations of a wireless network. When an SMS message is sent from a mobile phone it first reaches a SMS center that will then forward the SMS message to the destination. SMSCs also store SMS messages if a recipient is unavailable. [Adapted from The SMS Tutorial] 

SMT
Abbreviated as SMT, surface-mount technology is a design standard for constructing electronic  circuits where the components are mounted directly onto the the surface of the printed circuit board (PCB). The components have small metal tabs (or caps) that are soldered directly to the surface of the printed circuit board on tin-lead, silver, or gold plated copper pads, called solder pads. Contrast with through-hole technology. See "What You Need to Know About Motherboards" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia. 

SMTP
(pronounced as separate letters) Short for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, a protocol for sending e-mail messages between servers. Most e-mail systems that send mail over the Internet use SMTP to send messages from one server to another; the messages can then be retrieved with an e-mail client using either POP or IMAP. In addition, SMTP is generally used to send messages from a mail client to a mail server. This is why you need to specify both the POP or IMAP server and the SMTP server when you configure your e-mail application.


smurf
A type of network security breach in which a network connected to the Internet is swamped with replies to ICMP echo (PING) requests. A smurf attacker sends PING requests to an Internet broadcast address. These are special addresses that broadcast all received messages to the hosts connected to the subnet. Each broadcast address can support up to 255 hosts, so a single PING request can be multiplied 255 times. The return address of the request itself is spoofed to be the address of the attacker's victim. All the hosts receiving the PING request reply to this victim's address instead of the real sender's address. A single attacker sending hundreds or thousands of these PING messages per second can fill the victim's T-1 (or even T-3) line with ping replies, bring the entire Internet service to its knees.
Smurfing falls under the general category of Denial of Service attacks -- security attacks that don't try to steal information, but instead attempt to disable a computer or network.
 

SNA
SNA is short for Systems Network Architecture.
Systems Network Architecture is a set of network protocols developed by IBM. Originally designed in 1974 for IBM's mainframe computers, SNA has evolved over the years so that it now also supports  peer-to-peer networks of workstations.

snail_mail
Normal postal mail, where an actual physical letter or package is delivered. The term didn't exist until electronic mail (e-mail)became so prevalent that there was a requirement to differentiate the two. Obviously, the term was invented by e-mail aficionados as a small barb directed at the relative slowness of physical transportation.
Snailmail is sometimes spelled as two separate words, snail mail.

Snailmail is sometimes spelled as two separate words, snail mail.


snake_oil
Refers to a cryptography or security product that makes exaggerated claims of what the product is capable of, giving the user a false sense of security. The term snake oil, which is credited to Matt Curtin for using in reference to computer security products, comes from the 19th-century American practice of selling cure-all elixirs in traveling medicine shows. Snake oil salesmen would falsely claim that the potions would cure any ailments. The term has been appropriated to mean security and encryption products that make impossible claims, such as unbreakable codes.

snappy-ubuntu
 Snappy Ubuntu is an optimized lightweight version of the Ubuntu Linux operating system developed for mobile, cloud, containers, embedded and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Snappy Ubuntu made its official debut with the April 2015 "Vivid Vervet" Ubuntu 15.04 release.
Canonical, the developers of Ubuntu, created the Snappy Ubuntu Core Linux OS so that it runs and updates quickly, with only the bare minimum needed to operate and with updates able to be performed at large scale with minimal interruption to services.
With Snappy Ubuntu, the development model is extensible with apps separated from the base operating system, which enables developers to choose the packages they want to include. Snappy Ubuntu keeps each part of Ubuntu in a separate, read-only file, while doing the same for each application.

snapshot_backup
A virtual copy of a device or filesystem. Snapshots imitate the way a file or device looked at the precise time the snapshot was taken. It is not a copy of the data, only a picture in time of how the data was organized. Snapshots can be taken according to a scheduled time and provide a consistent view of a filesystem or device for a backup and recovery program to work from.

snapshot_printer
A color printer designed to print photographic-quality snapshots. Most snapshot printers require special paper and use dye sublimation, thermal transfer technologies to produce vivid 24-bit color. The devices, however, are limited to prints no larger than about 4 by 6 inches. 

snarf
Initially, in the realm of programming languages, snarf meant to grab a large document or file and use it without the author's permission. Since the development of UNIX, the UNIX community -- since there is not the same sense of proprietary ownership as there is in the commercial computer industry because it is based on an open source idea -- uses the term to mean the acquisition of a file or set of files across a network. It is a command line resource grabber, transferring files through the HTTP, gopher, finger and FTP protocols without user interaction. 

sneakernet
(jargon.) Refers to the channel by which electronic information is transmitted from one computer to another by physically carrying it stored on a floppy disk, CD or other removable medium. This play on words stems from the idea that a person is using their feet, i.e., sneakers, to transfer data instead of through the Internet or an organization's intranet. 

sneezer
An online marketing slang term coined by Charles Nicholls, founder of SeeWhy, to describe any customer that spreads your offers and promotions through social networks. Social networking sites make it incredibly easy for your "sneezer" customer to share promotions and positive word-of-mouth marketing about your business in a single click with his or her network of friends.  See also "Social Networking Sites" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

SNIA
Short for Storage Networking Industry Association, SNIA is a not-for-profit organization, made up of more than 300 companies and individuals spanning virtually the entire storage industry. SNIA members share a common goal, to advance the adoption of storage networks as complete and trusted solutions.

sniffer
A program and/or device that monitors data traveling over a network. Sniffers can be used both for legitimate network management functions and for stealing information off a network. Unauthorized sniffers can be extremely dangerous to a network's security because they are virtually impossible to detect and can be inserted almost anywhere. This makes them a favorite weapon in the hacker's arsenal.  On TCP/IP networks, where they sniff packets, they're often called packet sniffers.    

Snipping_Tool
In Windows Vista the Snipping Tool can be used to capture a screenshot (or a snip) of anything on your screen by launching the application then using the mouse to draw a box around the area you want to capture. In addition to grabbing the snip you can also annotate, save or share the image. In Windows Vista the Snipping Tool can be accessed by selecting: Start > All Programs > Accessories > Snipping Tool

SNMP
Short for Simple Network Management Protocol, a set of protocols for managing complex networks. The first versions of SNMP were developed in the early 80s. SNMP works by sending messages, called protocol data units (PDUs), to different parts of a network. SNMP-compliant devices, called agents, store data about themselves in Management Information Bases (MIBs)and return this data to the SNMP requesters.


snooping_protocol
(n.) Also referred to as a bus-snooping protocol, a protocol for maintaining cache coherency in symmetric multiprocessing environments. In a snooping system, all caches on the bus monitor (or snoop) the bus to determine if they have a copy of the block of data that is requested on the bus. Every cache has a copy of the sharing status of every block of physical memory it has. Multiple copies of a document in a multiprocessing environment typically can be read without any coherence problems; however, a processor must have exclusive access to the bus in order to write.
Snooping Protocol Types
There are two main types of snooping protocol:
Write-invalidate
The processor that is writing data causes copies in the caches of all other processors in the system to be rendered invalid before it changes its local copy. The local machine does this by sending an invalidation signal over the bus, which causes all of the other caches to check for a copy of the invalidated file. Once the cache copies have been invalidated, the data on the local machine can be updated until another processor requests it.

Snort
Snort is an open source network intrusion prevention system (IPS) capable of performing real-time traffic analysis and packet-logging on IP networks. It can perform protocol analysis, content searching & matching and can be used to detect a variety of attacks and probes, such as buffer overflows, stealth port scans, CGI attacks, SMB probes, OS fingerprinting attempts and more. Snort uses a flexible rules language to describe traffic that it should collect or pass, as well as a detection engine that uses a modular plug-in architecture. Snort has a real-time alerting capability as well, incorporating alerting mechanisms for syslog, a user-specified file, a UNIX socket, or WinPopup messages to Windows clients using Samba's smbclient. Snort has three primary uses. It can be used as a straight packet sniffer like tcpdump, a packet logger (useful for network traffic debugging and so), or as a full-blown network intrusion prevention system.  [Source: Snort Web site]

snowshoe_spamming
A slang term used to describe a method of delivering spam -- or unsolicited email. Snowshoe spamming refers to the technique of spreading spam across multiple IPs to evade spam filters.

SNR
Short for signal-to-noise ratio, the ratio of the amplitude of a desired analog or digital data signal to the amplitude of noise in a transmission channel at a specific point in time. SNR is typically expressed logarithmically in decibels (dB).  SNR measures the quality of a transmission channel or an audio signal over a network channel. The greater the ratio, the easier it is to identify and subsequently isolate and eliminate the source of noise. A SNR of zero indicates that the desired signal is virtually indistinguishable from the unwanted noise.  SNR also is abbreviated as S/N.

SNTP
Short for Simple Network Time Protocol, a simplified version of NTP. SNTP can be used when the ultimate performance of the full NTP implementation described in RFC 1305 is not needed or justified.

SO_DIMM
Short for Small Outline DIMM, a small version of a DIMM used commonly in notebook computers. Whereas a full-size DIMM has 168 pins and supports 64-bit transfers, a SO DIMM has only 72 pins, which supports only 32-bit transfers, or 144 pins, which supports a full 64-bit transfer. 

SOA
(n.) Abbreviated SOA, Service-Oriented Architecture is an application architecture in which all functions, or services, are defined using a description language and have invokable interfaces that are called to perform business processes. Each interaction is independent of each and every other interaction and the interconnect protocols of the communicating devices (i.e., the infrastructure components that determine the communication system do not affect the interfaces).
SOA Benefits and Disadvantages
SOA provides a strategic capability for integrating business processes, data, and organizational knowledge. Because interfaces are platform-independent, a client from any device using any operating system in any language can use the service. In a service-oriented architecture, clients consume services, rather than invoking discreet method calls directly. There are many benefits of SOA, including improved information flow, location transparency, internal software organization and better data translation. The most commonly discussed disadvantage of SOA is for applications with GUI functionality. These types of applications become more complex when using SOA.
SOA is Not Web Services
Although it is built on similar principles, SOA is not the same as Web services, which indicates a collection of technologies, such as SOAP and XML. Web services can be thought of as a consumer-provider relationship on the Web while SOA is about designing your architecture to best work in a Web service environment. It is more than a set of technologies and runs independent of any specific technologies.

Service_Oriented_Architecture
(n.) Abbreviated SOA, Service-Oriented Architecture is an application architecture in which all functions, or services, are defined using a description language and have invokable interfaces that are called to perform business processes. Each interaction is independent of each and every other interaction and the interconnect protocols of the communicating devices (i.e., the infrastructure components that determine the communication system do not affect the interfaces).

SOA provides a strategic capability for integrating business processes, data, and organizational knowledge. Because interfaces are platform-independent, a client from any device using any operating system in any language can use the service. In a service-oriented architecture, clients consume services, rather than invoking discreet method calls directly. There are many benefits of SOA, including improved information flow, location transparency, internal software organization and better data translation. The most commonly discussed disadvantage of SOA is for applications with GUI functionality. These types of applications become more complex when using SOA.
SOA is Not Web Services
Although it is built on similar principles, SOA is not the same as Web services, which indicates a collection of technologies, such as SOAP and XML. Web services can be thought of as a consumer-provider relationship on the Web while SOA is about designing your architecture to best work in a Web service environment. It is more than a set of technologies and runs independent of any specific technologies.

Service_Oriented_Analysis_Design_SOAD
Short for Service Oriented Analysis and Design. SOAD is a method of (or approach to) software development specially designed for Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). SOAD provides guidance for the design, build, aggregation, and deployment of applications such as web services built with technologies which can include SOAP, WSDL or UDDI. Also see Understanding "Web Services" in the "Did You Know...?" section of Webopedia. 

soaksoak-malware
SoakSoak is a strain of malware that leverages security vulnerabilities in a WordPress plug-in. These vulnerabilities are found in the RevSlider third-party plug-in, which is included in several popular themes for the open source blogging and content management system (CMS).
SoakSoak can utilize these vulnerabilities on unpatched or out-of-date WordPress systems to connect with the SoakSoak.ru domain and load JavaScript malware onto the infected Website. This malware includes a backdoor Trojan that enables control of the compromised WordPress site.
SoakSoak Large-Scale Attack in 2014
SoakSoak was launched as a large-scale attack on December 14th, 2014. Despite updated versions of the RevSlider plug-in being available since September of 2014, more than 100,000 WordPress sites were infected by the initial strain of SoakSoak.

SOAP
Short for Simple Object Access Protocol, a lightweight XML-based messaging protocol used to encode the information in Web service request and response messages before sending them over a network. SOAP messages are independent of any operating system or protocol and may be transported using a variety of Internet protocols, including SMTP, MIME, and HTTP.
Also see Understanding "Web Services" in the "Did You Know...?" section of Webopedia.

Service_Oriented_Business_Applications_SOBA
Short for Service Oriented Business Applications, SOBA represents the expected end state of the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) vision. That is, SOBAs are business applications that function in a service-oriented environment to provide discrete units of business-level functionality through well-defined service contracts (keeping the services encapsulated and self-contained). Within the SOA model these services can be dynamically combined as needed by the business. [Source: Skyway SOA Platform ] Also see Understanding "Web Services" in the "Did You Know...?" section of Webopedia.

SoC
Short for system-on-chip, a chip that holds all of the necessary hardware and electronic circuitry for a complete system. SoC includes on-chip memory (RAM and ROM), the microprocessor, peripheral interfaces, I/O logic control, data converters, and other components that comprise a complete computer system. Applications include digital cameras, cellular phones, set-top boxes, PDAs, and uses in nanotechnology and medical technology.

social_engineering
(sō ´sh&l en´´j&-nēr´ing) (n.) In the realm of computers, the act of obtaining or attempting to obtain otherwise secure data by conning an individual into revealing secure information. Social engineering is successful because its victims innately want to trust other people and are naturally helpful. The victims of social engineering are tricked into releasing information that they do not realize will be used to attack a computer network. For example, an employee in an enterprise may be tricked into revealing an employee identification number to someone who is pretending to be someone he trusts or representing someone he trusts. While that employee number may not seem valuable to the employee, which makes it easier for him to reveal the information in the first place, the social engineer can use that employee number in conjunction with other information that has been gathered to get closer to finding a way into the enterprise��s network.  Phishing is a type of security attack that relies on social engineering in that it lures the victim into revealing information based on the human tendency to believe in the security of a brand name because they associate the brand name with trustworthiness.

social_media
A term used to describe a variety of Web-based platforms, applications and technologies that enable people to socially interact with one another online. Some examples of social media sites and applications include Facebook, YouTube,  Del.icio.us, Twitter, Digg, blogs and other sites that have content based on user participation and user-generated content (UGC).
See "Social Media Tips for Online Marketing Plus 30 Social Media Sites" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia.

social_network
A social structure made of nodes that are generally individuals or organizations. A social network represents relationships and flows between people, groups, organizations, animals, computers or other information/knowledge processing entities. The term itself was coined in 1954 by J. A. Barnes. See also social network analysis.

social_network_analysis
Abbreviated as SNA, social network analysis is the mapping and measuring of relationships and flows between people, groups, organizations, animals, computers or other information/knowledge processing entities. The nodes in the network are the people and groups while the links show relationships or flows between the nodes. SNA provides both a visual and a mathematical analysis of human relationships.  [Source: orgnet.com]

social_networking_site
Abbreviated as SNS a social networking site is the phrase used to describe any Web sitethat enables users to create public profiles within that Web site and form relationships with other users of the same Web site who access their profile. Social networking sites can be used to describe community-based Web sites, online discussions forums, chatrooms and other social spaces online.
See also social network.


social_routing
The term used to describe communities or groups of individual Internet users who freely share their broadband Internet connection. FON is an example of a Wi-Fi community that uses social routing.

social_shopping
A slang term used to describe networked shopping. In electronic commerce it refers to consumers who use social networking services and sites to share their latest purchases, deals, coupons, product reviews, want lists, and other shopping finds. Some people may use affiliate links when they write about shopping and products on social spaces including MySpace, Facebook, Twitter and other networking services.

social_software
A type of software or Web service that allows people to communicate and collaborate while using the application. E-mail, blogs, and even instant messaging are all examples of social software.

socket
(1) In UNIX and some other operating systems, a software object that connects an application to a network protocol. In UNIX, for example, a program can send and receive TCP/IP messages by opening a socket and reading and writing data to and from the socket. This simplifies program development because the programmer need only worry about manipulating the socket and can rely on the operating system to actually transport messages across the network correctly. Note that a socket in this sense is completely soft  - it's a software object, not a physical component.  (2) A receptacle into which a plug can be inserted.  (3)A receptacle for a microprocessor or other hardware component. See also CPU socket.

socket_370
Socket 370 is Intel's new plastic PGA ZIF motherboard socket for its line of Celeron and Pentium processors.
If you still happen to use a Slot 1 motherboard, you can purchase a slotket, which will support socket 370 chips.

Socket_478
A type of CPU socket (also called processor socket) used for Intel Pentium 4 and the Celeron series CPUs. 478 is the number of holes in the socket for CPU pins. Motherboards that use Socket 478 can support DDR, RDRAM and some SDRAM memory. See "What You Need to Know About Motherboards" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

Socket_7
The form factor for fifth-generation CPU chips from Intel, Cyrix, and AMD. All Pentium chips, except Intel's Pentium Pro (Socket 8) and Pentium II (Slot 1), conform to the Socket 7 specifications. Intel has decided to phase out Socket 7 and replace it with Slot 1. 

Socket_754
A type of CPU socket (also called processor socket) used for AMD 64 bit microprocessors. 754 is the number of holes in the socket for CPU pins. Socket 754 supports up to 3 single channel memory DIMMs.

Socket_8
The form factor for Intel's Pentium Pro microprocessors. The Pentium Pro was the first microprocessor not to use the venerable Socket 7 form factor. The Pentium II microprocessors use an even newer form factor called Slot 1.  Socket 8 is a 387-pin ZIF socket with connections for the CPU and one or two SRAM dies for the Level 2 (L2) cache. 

Socket_939
A type of CPU socket (also called processor socket) used for the AMD64 range of processors. 939 is the number of holes in the socket for CPU pins. Motherboards that use Socket 939 can support dual channel DDR SDRAM memory.See "What You Need to Know About Motherboards" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

Socket_S1
A type of CPU socket (also called processor socket) used for AMD Turion 64, Athlon 64 Mobile and Sempron processors. The Socket S1 contains 638 holes in the socket for CPU pins. Socket S1 supports dual-channel DDR2 SDRAM, dual core mobile processors and also supports virtualization. Socket S1 may also be called AMD Socket 638.

Socket_T
More commonly called LGA775, Socket T is an Intel CPU socket (also called processor socket) that uses Land Grid Array (LGA). Socket T supports Pentium 4, Celeron, Core 2 and Quad Xeon. Using the word socket in connection with LGA775 is somewhat misleading. Traditionally CPU sockets contain holes that pin on the underside of the CPU it contacts with. However, with the LGA775 there are no holes, but instead 775 pins protrude from the CPU socket that make contact with points on the underside of the CPU.

SOCKS
A protocol for handling TCP traffic through a proxy server. It can be used with virtually any TCP application, including Web browsers and FTP clients. It provides a simple firewall because it checks incoming and outgoing packets and hides the IP addresses of client applications.  There are two main versions of SOCKS -- V4 and V5. V5 adds an authentication mechanism for additional security. There are many freeware implementations of both versions. One of the most common V5 implementations is SOCKS5, developed by NEC.  SOCKS was recently accepted as an IETF standard and is documented in RFC 1928, 1929 and 1961. 

sockstress
Also called TCP sockstress, sockstress is a potentially serious generic issue in many operating systems that affects the availability of TCP services. It is believed that a DoS attack exploiting the sockstress vulnerability uses half-open connections to deplete resources in the machines under attack. It very quickly causes specific services to become unavailable and may even require complete machine reboots. The attack may be effective against almost anything on a network, including Windows, BSD, Linux, embedded systems TCP/IP stack implementations, and others. May also be referred to as TCP state table manipulation vulnerability. See also "TCP Sockstress Brings Forth New OS Exploit Worries" on ServerWatch.com.

SOE
Abbreviated as SOE, Standard Operating Environment is a specification for a using a standard architecture and applications within an organization. There is no industry-wide SOE standardization, however organizations would usually deploy standard disks, operating systems, computer hardware (with the same configurations), and standard applications and software throughout their own organization.

Sofia_SIP
An open-source SIP (Session Initiated Protocol) User-Agent library that is used in building SIP client software for  VoIP, IM, and many other real time and person-to-person communication services. Sofia-SIP is compliant with the IETF RFC3261 specification. It is based on a SIP stack developed at the Nokia Research Center.

soft
In computer science, soft is used to describe things that are intangible. For example, you cannot touch software. It's like music -- you can see musical scores and touch CDs and tapes, but the music itself is intangible. Similarly, you can see software instructions (programs), and touch floppy disks on which the programs are stored, but the software itself is intangible.  Soft is also used to describe things that are easily changed or impermanent. In contrast, hard is used to describe things that are immutable.    

soft_boot
Same as warm boot.

soft_bounce
When e-mailing, soft bounce is used to describe an e-mail that has bounced back to the sender undelivered after it has already been accepted by the recipient's mail server.  Compare with hard bounce. Also see Why E-Mails Bounce in the Did You Know section of Webopedia.

soft_error
An error occurence in a computer's memory system that changes an instruction in a program or a data value. Soft errors typically can be remedied by cold booting the computer. A soft error will not damage a system's hardware; the only damage is to the data that is being processed.  There are two types of soft errors: chip-level soft error: These errors occur when the radioactive atoms in the chip's material decay and release alpha particles into the chip. Because an alpha particle contains a positive charge and kinetic energy, the particle can hit a memory cell and cause the cell to change state to a different value. The atomic reaction is so tiny that it does not damage the actual structure of the chip. Chip-level errors are rare because modern memory is so stable that it would take a typical computer with a large memory capacity at least 10 years before the radioactive elements of the chip's materials begin to decay. system-level soft error: These errors occur when the data being processed is hit with a noise phenomenon, typically when the data is on a data bus. The computer tries to interpret the noise as a data bit, which can cause errors in addressing or processing program code. The bad data bit can even be saved in memory and cause problems at a later time.   Contrast with hard error.

soft_font
A font that is copied from a computer's  disk to a printer's memory. Soft fonts can be erased, unlike resident fonts (fonts that are built into the printer) or font cartridges.  Soft fonts are generated by a font program in the computer. You can control the program to specify the font size and other characteristics. The disadvantages of soft fonts are that they require a lot of disk space and printer memory (from 10K to over 200K for a single font), and it takes time to download the fonts to the printer.  Soft fonts are also called downloadable fonts.   

soft_phone
(sâft fMn) (n.) Also spelled as softphone, an application that enables a desktop, laptop or workstation computer to function as a telephone via Voice over IP technology that uses the cables of a computer network as the medium for transmitting telephone service. Equipped with a headset or a hand-held device, and using the numbers on the keyboard to dial, the computer with soft phone software can perform the full range of telephone features available through traditional systems, such as teleconferencing and call forwarding. Soft phones typically make use of the computer's sound card for audio input and output.
Soft phones are typical call centers and other businesses that rely heavily on a combination of computers and telephones.

soft_return
The term return refers to moving to the beginning of the next line in a text document. Word processors utilize two types of returns: hard and soft. In both cases, the return consists of special codes inserted into the document to cause the display screen, printer, or other output device to advance to the next line.  The difference between the two types of returns is that soft returns are inserted automatically by the word processor as part of its word wrap capability. Whenever too little room remains on the current line for the next word, the word processor inserts a soft return. The position of soft returns automatically changes, however, if you change the length of a line by adding or deleting words, or if you change the margins.  A hard return, on the other hand, always stays in the same place unless you explicitly delete it. Whenever you press the Return or Enter key, the word processor inserts a hard return. Hard returns are used to create new paragraphs or to align items in a table.   

softlifting
A type of software piracy that occurs when users share their software with other users who are not authorized to have access by the End-User License Agreement (EULA). The most common type of softlifting occurs when a person does legitimately purchase software but installs it onto multiple computers which is a violation of the licensing agreement. Softlifting  may also be called softloading or end-user piracy. See software piracy. Also see"Is Software Ownership the Same as Licensing?" in the in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia.

softswitch
Short for software switch, a softswitch is an API that is used to bridge a traditional PSTN and VoIP by linking PSTN to IP networks and managing traffic that contains a mixture of voice, fax, data and video. Softswitches are able to process the signaling for all types of packet protocols. Softswitch is a software-based switching platform, which is opposed to traditional hardware-based switching center technology. Softswitches also are based on open systems, another difference between them and traditional proprietary hardware switching systems.  Softswitch is also called media gateway controller, call agent and gatekeeper.

software
Software means computer  instructions or data. Anything that can be stored electronically is software, in contrast to storage devices and display devices which are called hardware.
The Difference Between Software and Hardware
The terms software and hardware are used as both nouns and adjectives. For example, you can say: "The problem lies in the software," meaning that there is a problem with the program or data, not with the computer itself. You can also say: "It is a software problem."
The distinction between software and hardware is sometimes confusing because they are so integrally linked. Clearly, when you purchase a program, you are buying software. But to buy the software, you need to buy the disk (hardware) on which the software is recorded.

Software_Configuration_Management
Software Configuration Management (SCM) is the the overall management of a software design project as it evolves into a software product or system. This includes technical aspects of the project, all level of communications, organization, and the control of modifications changes to the project plan by the programmers during the development phase. Software Configuration Management is also called Software Control Management.

software_cooling
Often called softcooling, software cooling is a type of computer system cooling that uses software to access the CPU's power-saving technology. Soft cooling can be used to halt instructions to turn off or standby turn off or put in standby state CPU subparts that aren't being used or by under clocking the CPU.

software_engineer
A software engineer is a licensed professional engineer who is schooled and skilled in the application of engineering discipline to the creation of software. A software engineer is often confused with a programmer, but the two are vastly different disciplines. While a programmer creates the codes that make a program run, a software engineer creates the designs the programmer implements. By U.S. law no person may use the title "engineer" (of any type) unless the person holds a professional engineering license from a state licensing board and are in good standing. A software engineer is also held accountable to a specific code of ethics.
(Many thanks go out to Jerry G. Nordby, P.E., Technical Director for Defense Programs, for providing this updated definition)

software_engineering
The computer science discipline concerned with developing large applications. Software engineering covers not only the technical aspects of building software systems, but also management issues, such as directing programming teams, scheduling, and budgeting.


software_entropy
Software entropy refers to the tendency for software, over time, to become difficult and costly to maintain. A software system that undergoes continuous change, such as having new functionality added to its original design, will eventually become more complex and can become disorganized as it grows, losing its original design structure.
In theory, it may be better to redesign the software in order to support the changes rather than building on the existing program, but redesigning the software is more work because redesigning the existing software will introduce new bugs and problems.

software_environment
Software environment is the term commonly used to refer to support an application. A software environment for a particular application could include the  operating system, the database system, specific development tools or compiler.

software_licensing
Allowing an individual or group to use a piece of software. Nearly all applications are licensed rather than sold. There are a variety of different types of software licenses. Some are based on the number machines on which the licensed program can run whereas others are based on the number of users that can use the program. Most personal computer software licenses allow you to run the program on only one machine and to make copies of the software only for backup purposes. Some licenses also allow you to run the program on different computers as long as you don't use the copies simultaneously.


software_modem
A modem implemented entirely in software. Software modems rely on the computer's processor to modulate and demodulate signals. 

software_package
(1) A special method of distributing and installing software (or software upgrades) to a computer. For example, on a Macintosh computer, a package usually means "software." It's specifically a directory, presented as a single file, that contains all the information the Mac OS X Installer application needs to install your software. That includes the software itself, as well as files that are used only during the installation process. In a Windows environment it is sometimes called an installation package or update package.
(2) Multiple software programs that work together (or performs similar functions) and is bundled and sold together as a software package.

software_piracy
The unauthorized copying of software. Most retail programs are licensed for use at just one computer site or for use by only one user at any time. By buying the software, you become a licensed user rather than an owner (see EULA). You are allowed to make copies of the program for backuppurposes, but it is against the law to give copies to friends and colleagues.
Software piracy is all but impossible to stop, although software companies are launching more and more lawsuits against major infractors. Originally, software companies tried to stop software piracy by copy-protectingtheir software. This strategy failed, however, because it was inconvenient for users and was not 100 percent foolproof. Most software now requires some sort of registration, which may discourage would-be pirates, but doesn't really stop software piracy.
Some common types of software piracy include counterfeit software, OEM unbundling, softlifting, hard disk loading, corporate software piracy, and Internet software piracy.

Software_Plus_Services
Software Plus Services (Software + Services) is Microsoft's philosophy for complementing the software company's on-premises  software offerings with cloud-based remote computing software options. The approach is based on providing the benefits of both traditional physical-based software and Web-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) delivery methods in order to create more effective software solution options for customers.
Microsoft's Software + Services cloud strategy seeks to strike an ideal balance between the flexibility and interoperability of Web applications and the versatility and increased functionality available with PC-centric applications.
Also see  software-as-a-service (SaaS),  cloud computing and application service provider (ASP) terms in Webopedia. 

Software_Quality_Assurance
Abbreviated as SQA, and also called software assurance, it is a level of confidence that software is free from vulnerabilities, either intentionally designed into the software or inserted at anytime during its lifecycle, and that the software functions in the intended manner. 

software-defined_everything
A marketing phrase that serves to group a variety of software-defined computing technologies into one overarching moniker. The umbrella of Software-Defined Everything (SDE) technologies includes, among other terms, software-defined networking (SDN), software-defined computing, software-defined data centers (SDDC), software-defined storage (SDS) and software-defined storage networks. With Software-Defined Everything, the computing infrastructure is virtualized and delivered as a service. In a Software-Defined Everything environment, management and control of the networking, storage and/or data center infrastructure is automated by intelligent software rather than by the hardware components of the infrastructure.


software-defined_servers
A marketing term coined by HP for its ultra-low power Project Moonshot servers developed for specific data center workloads such as cloud computing and big data. The HP Moonshot software-defined servers use 89 percent less power and 80 percent less space than traditional server systems and reduce complexity by 97 percent.
Benefits of Software Defined Servers
Software-defined servers achieve these feats by sharing a variety of components, including cooling and networking and power supplies, as well as management software such as HP’s Integrated Lights-Out software tools. Software-defined servers derive their name from these shared software management tools, which are able to dynamically assign and efficiently manage workloads across the servers in a system.


SOHO
Short for small office/home office, a term that refers to the small or home office environment and the business culture that surrounds it. A SOHO is often thought of as being the smallest of small businesses. It is a privately owned and operated business or individuals who are self-employed. SOHO is often characterized as being a small in both the size of the office space and number of employees.
As a general guideline, a small office is considered to be any firm with fewer than 10 employees, although in more recent years, some research and marketing firms have taken to categorizing SOHO as a firm with 1-4 employees. Firms with 5 or more employees are considered different categories within the small business sector (e.g. 5-9, 10-19, and so on, up to 100 employees).
In some cases the workplace is designated space established within the business owner's residence ("home office") where they conduct their business tasks on a regular basis.  

SOI
Short for silicon-on-insulator, a type of semiconductor fabrication technique developed by IBM. Unlike CMOS-based chips that are doped with impurities that enable a chip to store capacitance that must be discharged and recharged, SOI chips are formed by setting transistors on a thin silicon layer that is separated from the silicon substrate by an insulating layer of thin silicon oxide or glass, which minimizes capacitance (or the energy absorbed from the transistor).

SOIC
Short for Small Outline Integrated Circuit. A SOIC package is a leaded rectangular surface mount integrated circuit with eight or more gull wings leads, bent outwards at the tip. The leads are on two length sides of the package. SOIC packages are JEDEC compliant.

SoIP
Short for Storage over IP, SoIP technology refers to the merging of Fibre Channel technologies with IP-based technology to allow for accessing storage devices over TCP/IP networks. SoIP is the framework for storage area networking (SAN) using Internet Protocol (IP) networks to directly connect servers and storage. SoIP products are designed to support transparent interoperability of storage devices based on Fibre Channel, SCSI, and a new class of Gigabit Ethernet storage devices using iSCSI and iFCP. Existing Fibre Channel or SCSI devices, such servers with host bus adapters (HBAs) or storage subsystems, can be included in an SoIP storage network without modification. [Adapted from Nishan Systems]
This technology is being standardized under the IP Storage (ips) IETF Working Group. Also referred to as SoIP Framework. 

SOJ
Short for Small-Outline J-lead, a type of chip module that uses J-shaped pins that extend inwards. Unlike DIPs, which plug into holes on the circuit board, an SOJ chip attaches directly to the circuit board's surface.  

solar_fade
(n.) Also referred to as sun fade, sun outage or solar outage, a signal degradation phenomenon that affects the transmission of radio signals in satellite communications.  GEO satellites orbit the earth above the equator and rely on microwave signals in the radio frequency spectrum for communications with an earth-bound antenna. The sun also emits large amounts of electromagnetic energy in the microwave portion of the spectrum. Through the majority of the year, the radio frequency energy from the sun does not affect satellite communications. However, during the spring and fall equinoxes the sun is positioned above the earth's equator (in the equatorial plane) and therefore will align itself behind the GEO satellites as they move with the earth's rotation. When the sun is directly behind a satellite the radio signals of the satellite communications are overpowered by the sun's radio frequency energy, creating noise, and the communications are therefore disrupted.  Signal interference only occurs once a day for any satellite and usually lasts less than eight minutes, though many factors, including antenna size and downlink frequency, effect the duration and intensity of the solar fade. The exact date and time of solar fade is different for each satellite. Many satellite operators have solar fade calculators accessible on the Internet.

Solaris
An Unix-based operating environment developed by Sun Microsystems. Originally developed to run on Sun's SPARC workstations, Solaris now runs on many workstations from other vendors.  Solaris includes the SunOS operating system and a windowing system (either OpenWindows or CDE). Solaris currently supports multithreading, symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), integrated TCP/IP networking, and centralized network administration. A Wabi emulator is available to run Windows applications.  

solid_ink_jet_printer
A type of color printer that works by melting wax-based inks and then spraying them on paper. Solid ink-jet printers produce very vivid colors and can print on nearly any surface. Early models of solid ink-jet printers were quite slow and expensive. Today however you can purchase color office solid ink-jet printers in and around the $1000 price range with an output of 24 color pager per minute (ppm).  Solid ink-jet printers are also called phase-change printers. 

solus_e_mail
Solus email is a term used in the email marketing industry. A solus email is a third-party advertisement that is sent to an opt-in subscription email list that is comprised of demographics of target consumers that the third party wants to advertise to.
An example of a solus email marketing would be for the owner of an opt-in list related to Internet security to allow an anti-virus software company to send a direct advertising email about their Internet security product to members of the opt-in list. The e-mail advertisement will generally not show any information about the Web site or company who owns the email list, but will appear to come directly to you from the third party brand.
Solus e-mail marketing is also called direct e-mail marketing.See also piggyback email.

SOM
Short for System Object Model, an architecture developed by IBM that allows binary code to be shared by different applications. It serves the same purpose as Microsoft's competing COM standard. SOM is a full implementation of CORBA. A distributed version of SOM that allows binary objects to be shared across networks is known as DSOM. 

Service_Oriented_Modeling_Architecture_SOMA
Short for Service Oriented Modeling and Architecture, it refers to the more general domain of service modeling necessary to design and create a Service-Oriented Architecture. SOMA covers a broader scope and implements service oriented analysis and design through the identification, specification and realization of services, components and flows. [Source: Skyway SOA Platform] Also see Understanding "Web Services" in the "Did You Know...?" section of Webopedia.

SONET
Short for Synchronous Optical Network, a standard for connecting fiber-optic transmission systems. SONET was proposed by Bellcore in the middle 1980s and is now an ANSI standard.
SONET defines interface standards at the physical layer of the OSI seven-layer model. The standard defines a hierarchy of interface rates that allow data streams at different rates to be multiplexed. SONET establishes Optical Carrier (OC) levels from 51.8 Mbps (OC-1) to 9.95 Gbps (OC-192). Prior rate standards used by different countries specified rates that were not compatible for multiplexing. With the implementation of SONET, communication carriers throughout the world can interconnect their existing digital carrier and fiber optic systems.
The international equivalent of SONET, standardized by the ITU, is called SDH.

sony_playstation
Sony PlayStation is a line of video game console devices designed by Sony to compete with other gaming platforms like Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s Xbox 360. The current edition, PlayStation 3, or simply PS3, debuted in November 2006 with added support for Blu-ray Discs (BD), full High Definition resolution graphics, PlayStation Portable connectivity and motion control in games through the new SIXAXIS wireless controller.
PlayStation 3 also introduced support for the PlayStation Network, an online gaming and entertainment content service that provides streamed TV, movie and music content as well as online multiplayer "social" gaming with voice, text and video chat support.
There are rumors of a 2012 release for the Sony PlayStation 4, which will serve as the successor to the PS3.  The PlayStation 4 is expected to compete with new Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Xbox gaming devices that are also expected to debut in 2012.

sony_playstation_4
A next-generation PlayStation gaming and entertainment system from Sony that is currently scheduled to arrive in late 2013. At $399 the Sony PlayStation 4 is priced attractively to compete with the more expensive Microsoft Xbox One, which will retail for $499.
Furthering its aggressive play against the Xbox One system, the Sony PlayStation 4 also lacks the required internet connection as well as restrictions on the resale of used games that Microsoft’s Xbox One is expected to impose. At the same time, the Sony PlayStation 4 doesn’t offer the extensive entertainment connectivity that the Xbox One system offers, lacking Skype video support and the rich TV and movie content available through the Xbox One.

SOP
Short for Small Outline Package, it's a low-profile rectangular surface-mount component package. Its chip is bonded to an inner land contact area (usually a lead frame). External terminals exit parallel to the seating plane on two opposite sides of the moulded, flat package. SOPs use gull wing formed leads, and is a surface mount package with a fixed lead pitch of .050".

sopa
Introduced by U.S. Representative Lamar Smith, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) is a United States bill intended to extend the U.S. law enforcement to "fight online trafficking in copyrighted intellectual property and counterfeit goods." The law would expand existing laws to include unauthorized streaming of copyright material and impose a maximum penalty of five years in prison.
Under SOPA, law enforcement could request court orders to bar advertising networks and payment facilities from conducting business with infringing websites, bar search engines from linking to the sites, require Internet service providers (ISPs) to block access to the websites.
The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) is a controversial bill as proponents claim the bill would protect the intellectual property market, and that it has become necessary to increase enforcement of copyright laws. Opponents claim SOPA threatens free speech and enables law enforcement to block access to entire Internet domains due to infringing material posted on a single webpage or blog.

SORBS
Acronym for Spam and Open Relay Blocking System.
 
SORBS was originally an anti-spam project where a daemon would check, in real time, all servers from which it received  e-mail to determine if that e-mail was sent via various types of proxy and open-relay servers. SORBS has evolved into SORBS DNSbl (DNS-based blacklist) which now includes more than 3 million listed hosts that are considered to be compromised (Web servers which have vulnerabilities that can be used by spammers).

Sorenson_compressor
A lossy QuickTime codec that offers a higher quality than the previously used Cinepak codec. The Sorenson compressor is frequently used to compress video from video cameras. A Sorenson compressor uses both  temporal and spatial compression techniques. Sorenson compressor was jointly created by companies Sorenson Vision and Terran Interactive.

SoSaaS
Slang term. Short for Same old Software, as a Service.See also SaaS.

sound_card
An expansion board that enables a computer to manipulate and output sounds. Sound cards are necessary for nearly all CD-ROMs and have become commonplace on modern personal computers. Sound cards enable the computer to output sound through speakers connected to the board, to record sound input from a microphone connected to the computer, and manipulate sound stored on a disk.  Nearly all sound cards support MIDI, a standard for representing music electronically. In addition, most sound cards are Sound Blaster-compatible, which means that they can process commands written for a Sound Blaster card, the de facto standard for PC sound.  Sound cards use two basic methods to translate digital data into analog sounds:  FM Synthesis mimics different musical instruments according to built-in formulas. Wavetable Synthesis relies on recordings of actual instruments to produce sound. Wavetable synthesis produces more accurate sound, but is also more expensive.    

source
(1) A place from which data is taken. Many computer  commands involve moving data. The place from which the data is moved is called the source, whereas the place it is moved to is called the destination or target. If you copy a file from one directory to another, for example, you copy it from the source directory to the destination directory. The source and destination can be files, directories, or devices (that is, printers or storage devices).   (2) The node on a network from which data is sent to its destination.

source_code
Program instructions in their original form. The word source differentiates code from various other forms that it can have (for example, object code and executable code).
Initially, a programmer writes a program in a particular programming language. This form of the program is called the source  program, or more generically, source code. To execute the program, however, the programmer must translate it into machine language, the language that the computer understands. The first step of this translation process is usually performed by a utility called a compiler. The compiler translates the source code into a form called object code. Sometimes the object code is the same as machine code; sometimes it needs to be translated into machine language by a utility called an assembler.
Source code is the only format that is readable by humans. When you purchase programs, you usually receive them in their machine-language format. This means that you can execute them directly, but you cannot read or modify them. Some softwaremanufacturers provide source code, but this is useful only if you are an experienced programmer.

source_code_control_system
Abbreviated as SCCS, source code control system is tool used to track the development of a source file to prevent it from being altered by more than one person at a time. It is commonly used for projects where multiple source files are used or where multiple people are working with the source file. When seen written in all capital letters, Source Code Control System refers to the first source code revision control system, which was developed at Bell Labs in 1972 by Marc J. Rochkind. See also source code manager.

source_code_manager
Abbreviated as SCM, source code manager is a set of tools used to manage the coding source for teamwork on Windows or UNIX platforms. SCM provides a permanent and secure data repository for source components. See also source code control system.

Southbridge
In Northbridge/Southbridge chipset architecture designs, the Southbridge is the chip that controls all of the computers I/O functions, such as USB, audio, serial, the system BIOS, the ISA bus, the interrupt controller and the IDE channels. In other words, all of the functions of a processor except memory, PCI and AGP.  The Southbridge chip is one of two chips that control the functions of the chipset. The other is the Northbridge. The Northbridge can consist of more than one discrete chips while the Southbridge is typically only one discrete chip that rests on the Northbridge��s PCI bus.

SP
Short for stack page, a reserved space in Windows of 4K of memory that a 32-bit device driver uses to hold data and instructions as it works. The default setting in Windows sets one stack page for device drivers and two spare pages for temporary allocations. The spare pages are called MinSPs, short for minimum stack pages.

space_shifting
The act of copying digital content for use on a device other than the one for which it is was originally intended, such as copying a music from a compact disc to an MP3 file for use on a portable MP3 player, or copying an MP3 file onto a compact disc for use in a digital audio player.

spaghetti_marketing
Slang term used to describe the random spending of marketing dollars in an unorganized, unplanned way. The slang term is derived from cooking spaghetti where one might "throw spaghetti against the wall to see if it sticks".

spam
Spam is usually considered to be electronic junk mail or junk newsgroup postings. Some people define spam even more generally as any unsolicited email. However, if a long-lost brother finds your email address and sends you a message, this could hardly be called spam, even though it is unsolicited. Real spam is generally email advertising for some product sent to a mailing list or newsgroup.
Why Spam is a Problem
In addition to wasting people's time with unwanted email, spam also eats up a lot of network bandwidth. Consequently, there are many organizations, as well as individuals, who have taken it upon themselves to fight spam with a variety of techniques. But because the Internet is public, there is really little that can be done to prevent spam, just as it is impossible to prevent junk mail. However, some online services have instituted policies to prevent spammers from spamming their subscribers.


spam_blocker
Spam blocker is the  phrase used to describe a type of computer software that is designed to prevent spam, or unsolicited e-mail sent in bulk to a large number of recipients, from going directly to the inbox of your e-mail client.
Also known as spam filters, spam fighters or  anti-spam utilities, spam blocking  software has evolved from simply watching for  keywords in the subject line of messages to using advanced  technology like Bayesian and similar  heuristic filters to help identify spam through suspicious word patterns or word frequency.
See   All About Software: categories of applications software explained.Also see  "Getting Rid of Spam" and   "All About Spam, Spim and Spit" in the  Did You Know section of Webopedia.

spam_trap
An option in an e-mail that appears to be a legitimate unsubscribe option. When the e-mail recipient clicks the link and unsubscribe, they are actually validating their e-mail address to the spammer for future use.

spamdexing-definition
The practice of using improper Search Engine Optimization (SEO) tactics in an attempt to manipulate or elevate the placement of a web site on a search engine's search results pages (SERP). Also referred to as search engine spam or Black Hat SEO, spamdexing can include activities such as keyword stuffing, link spamming, duplication of copyrighted content, page hijacking and more.
Content Spamdexing and Link Spamdexing
A combination of the words spam and indexing, spamdexing can be broken down into two primary forms: content spamdexing and link spamdexing. The former involves manipulating the content on web pages in ways that are inconsistent with the guidelines of search engines. Content spamdexing can include tactics such as keyword stuffing, meta tag stuffing, the use of invisible text on web pages, gateway or doorway pages, duplication of copyrighted content from high-ranking web sites and more.
The second category of spamdexing, link spamdexing, refers to the use of improper links to or from web pages in an attempt to artificially elevate the reputation of a web page or site by a search engine. Link spamdexing can include activities such as the use of purchased links or link-generating software tools, link farms, hidden links on pages, pagejacking, cookie stuffing, comment spamming with web links and more.

spamdress
Slang term for spam e-mail address, a person's secondary e-mail address, which is used for registering to receive newsletters, discussion forums and for other Web sites requiring sign-ups where you may receive frequent e-mails. The spamdress is used in place of a primary e-mail address to assist in keeping spam out of the primary account. Also called spamaddress.  Also see  Getting Rid of Spam in the Did You Know section of Webopedia.

spamware
Software that is used by spammers to send out automated spam e-mail. Spamware packages may also include an e-mail harvesting tool.

spanning_tree_protocol
Abbreviated STP, a link management protocol that is part of the IEEE 802.1 standard for media access control bridges. Using the spanning tree algorithm, STP provides path redundancy while preventing undesirable loops in a network that are created by multiple active paths between stations. Loops occur when there are alternate routes between hosts. To establish path redundancy, STP creates a tree that spans all of the switches in an extended network, forcing redundant paths into a standby, or blocked, state. STP allows only one active path at a time between any two network devices (this prevents the loops) but establishes the redundant links as a backup if the initial link should fail. If STP costs change, or if one network segment in the STP becomes unreachable, the spanning tree algorithm reconfigures the spanning tree topology and reestablishes the link by activating the standby path. Without spanning tree in place, it is possible that both connections may be simultaneously live, which could result in an endless loop of traffic on the LAN. 

SPARC
Short for Scalable Processor Architecture, a RISC technology developed by Sun Microsystems. The term SPARC® itself is a trademark of SPARC International, an independent organization that licenses the term to Sun for its use. Sun's workstations based on the SPARC include the SPARCstation, SPARCserver, Ultra1, Ultra2 and SPARCcluster. 

SPARQL
Short for Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language, SPARQL defines a standard query language and data access protocol for use with the Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model. It works for any data source that can be mapped to RDF. The specification is under development by the RDF Data Access Working Group (DAWG).

spatial_compression
A compression algorithm applied to a single frame of video independently, where the video image is compressed much like a JPEG image would be compressed. 

spatial_data
Also known as geospatial data or geographic information it is the data or information that identifies the geographic location of features and boundaries on Earth, such as natural or constructed features, oceans, and more. Spatial data is usually stored as coordinates and topology, and is data that can be mapped. Spatial data is often accessed, manipulated or analyzed through Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

spatial_modeling
Analytical procedures applied with GIS. It is the set of procedures that simulates real-world conditions within a GIS using the spatial relationships of geographic features.  See also spatial data.

spawn
In video and computer games spawn is the reforming or appearance of a player somewhere in the game level. In FPS games, when a character is fragged the game is not over, but rather the character spawns in one of several set locations in the map and continues playing. Usually when a character spawns after a frag they no longer have any items and special abilities they had before being fragged. Also see  All About Multiplayer PC Gaming in Webopedia's "Did You Know...?" section.

SPD
Short for serial presence detect, a category of information that is stored in an EEPROM chip on a memory module and communicated to the BIOS when the computer is booted. The SPD tells the BIOS the module��s data, such as its size, data width, manufacturer, speed, row and column addresses and voltage. With the information the BIOS can configure the memory controller to maximize performance and to reduce the chances of performance failures.

speaker
An electro-acoustic transducer that converts electrical signals into sounds loud enough to be heard at a distance. Synonymous with loudspeaker.

spear_phishing
A type of phishing attack that focuses on a single user or department within an organization, addressed from someone within the company in a position of trust and requesting information such as login IDs and passwords.  Spear phishing scams will often appear to be from a company's own human resources or technical support divisions and may ask employees to update their username and passwords. Once hackers get this data  they can gain entry into secured networks. Another type of spear phishing attack will ask users to click on a link, which deploys spyware that can thieve data. Also see the All About Phishing page in the "Did You Know? section of Webopedia for more information, including examples, of phishing.

SPEC
(1) Acronym for Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation, a nonprofit corporation set up by many computer and microprocessor vendors to create a standard set of benchmark tests. The most widely used set of tests, known as SPEC CPU2000 contains two benchmark suites: CINT2000 for measuring and comparing compute-intensive integer performance, and CFP2000 for measuring and comparing compute-intensive floating point performance. The SPEC CPU2000 benchmark tests are also called CPU2000 tests. SPEC CPU95 preceded SPEC CPU2000 which will be followed by CPU2006. (2) Short for specification, as in a functional specification. 

special_character
A character that is not a letter, number, symbol, or punctuation mark. Control characters, for example, are special characters, as are special formatting characters such as paragraph marks. 

speech_synthesis
Refers to a computer's ability to produce sound that resembles human speech. Although they can't imitate the full spectrum of human cadences and intonations, speech synthesis systems can read text files and output them in a very intelligible, if somewhat dull, voice. Many systems even allow the user to choose the type of voice -- for example, male or female. Speech synthesis systems are particularly valuable for seeing-impaired individuals.   

spell_checker
A program that checks the spelling of words in a text document. Spell checkers are particularly valuable for catching typos, but they do not help much when your misspelling creates another valid word; for example, you type too instead of to.  Many word processors come with a built-in spell checker, but you can also purchase stand-alone utilities.  

SPF
Short for Sender Policy Framework, an extension of SMTP that stops e-mail spammers from forging the "From" fields in an e-mail. As SMTP itself does not carry an authenticating mechanism, the SPF extension provides the authentication scheme by specifying which computers are authorized to send email from a specific domain. In order to use SPF, the domain sending e-mails must establish an SPF record that is published in DNS records. When the e-mail passes through the DNS server, it is compared to the SPF record for that domain to determine if the sender is indeed authorized to transmit e-mails from that sender's address. If the e-mail comes from a domain that is not authorized, the DNS server will not forward the e-mail to the expected destination.
SPF is one method that can be used to stop spam from being sent using unauthorized domain names. However, it should be noted that SPF only stops the spammer from forging the "From" field in the e-mail and does not stop the spammer from sending e-mails from a domain in which it is a member.
SPF was formerly called Sender Permitted Form, but the name was later changed while the abbreviation remained the same.

SPI
(1) Short for Serial Peripheral Interface, a full-duplex synchronous serial interface for connecting low-/medium-bandwidth external devices using four wires. SPI devices communicate using a master/slave relationship over two data lines and two control lines:   Master Out Slave In (MOSI): supplies the output data from the master to the inputs of the slaves.  Master In Slave Out (MISO): supplies the output data from a slave to the input of the master. It is important to note that there can be no more than one slave that is transmitting data during any particular transfer.  Serial Clock (SCLK): a control line driven by the master, regulating the flow of data bits.  Slave Select (SS): a control line that allows slaves to be turned on and off with  hardware control.   (2) Short for System Packet Interface, a point-to-point interface standard, allows network equipment designers to develop an array of next-generation multi-service switches and routers to support multi-service traffic with aggregate bandwidths up to OC-192 (10 Gb/s) and beyond, enabling them to dramatically increase system performance. It is a family of Interoperability Agreements from the Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF) which include:  System Packet Interface Level 5 (SPI-5): OC-768 System Interface for Physical and Link Layer Devices. (OIF documentation) System Packet Interface Level 4 (SPI-4) Phase 2: OC-192 System Interface for Physical and Link Layer Devices.(OIF documentation) System Physical Interface Level 4 (SPI-4) Phase 1: A System Interface for Interconnection Between Physical and Link Layer, or Peer-to-Peer Entities Operating at an OC-192 Rate (10 Gb/s)  (OIF documentation) System Packet Interface Level 3: OC-48 System Interface for Physical and Link Layer Devices (OIF documentation) 

SPICE
Short for Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environment, SPICE is a hosted virtual desktop protocol and a key part of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization for Desktops. The SPICE protocol is designed to optimize performance by automatically adapting to the graphics and communications environment that it is running in. SPICE was initially developed by Qumranet; however, in 2008 Red Hat purchased Qumranet and in 2009 Red Hat announced it would open source SPICE.  See also "Red Hat open sources SPICE for desktop virtualization" on InternetNews.com.

SPID
Acronym for Service Profile Identifier, a number that identifies a specific ISDN line. When you obtain ISDN service, your telephone company assigns a SPID to your line. Part of the initialization procedure is to configure your ISDN terminal adapter to use this SPID.  Most telephone companies in the U.S. use the Generic SPID Format, which is a 14-digit number. The first 10 digits identify the telephone number, called the Directory Number (DN). The remaining four digits identify a particular ISDN device, in the case where multiple devices share the same Directory Number. 

spider
A program that automatically fetches Web pages. Spiders are used to feed pages to search engines. It's called a spider because it crawls over the Web. Another term for these programs is webcrawler.
Because most Web pages contain links to other pages, a spider can start almost anywhere. As soon as it sees a link to another page, it goes off and fetches it. Large search engines, like Alta Vista, have many spiders working in parallel.
Also see How Web Search Engines Work in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia.

spider_trap
(spī´dër trap) (n.) A condition of dynamic Web sites in which a search engine��s spider becomes trapped in an endless loop of code where a spider��s request for a page from a Web server is met with a the server��s request for an information input from the spider, which cannot provide information to the server as it is only collecting data for the search engine��s index. Spider traps are the result of poorly written cgi scripts and potentially can crash a server and/or prevent the spider from returning to a site.

spim
(n.) Also spelled as spIM, spam over instant messaging (IM). Spim is perpetuated by bots that harvest IM screen names off of the Internet and simulate a human user by sending spam to the screen names via an instant message. The spim typically contains a link to a Web site that the spimmer is trying to market.  Also referred to as instant spam or the less-intrusive sounding IM marketing.  (v.) To send someone spam through an instant messaging application.  A spimmer is the individual or organization responsible for sending the spim.

spin_stabilization
In satellite communications, spin stabilization is a method of satellite stabilization and attitude control. Spin stabilization is achieved by spinning the exterior of the spacecraft on its axis at a fixed rate.

spin_valve
Another name for a GMR head. The term was coined by IBM. See GMR.

spindle
The shaft that rotates in the middle of a disk drive. In a removable disk, the spindle remains attached to the drive, as with a CD-ROM ; with a fixed disk the spindle remains attached to the platter. Laptop computers these days are often described by the number of spindles. The increasingly common three-spindle laptop houses three drives - one for the hard disk, one for floppy disks, one for CD-ROMs.  

spit
According to Internet and technical publications, spit (spam over internet telephony) is already an acronym, even though as of October 2004 there have been no reported cases of spit. Much like spam and spim, it is believed that as internet telephony becomes more popular with consumers, spit is sure to follow. In September 2004, a U.S.-based company called Qovia filed two patent applications for technology to stop spam over Internet telephony or voice-over IP (VoIP) that involves making phone calls using the Internet.

splash_page
The page of a Web site that the user sees first before being given the option to continue to the main content of the site. Splash pages are used to promote a company, service or product or are used to inform the user of what kind of software or browser is necessary in order to view the rest of the site's pages. Often a splash page will consist of animated graphics and sounds that entice the user into exploring the rest of the Web site. Some splash pages will bring the user to the main Web site automatically, and some require the user to click on a link that will load the main page.  A splash page is sometimes referred to as a splash screen.

spline
In computer graphics, a smooth curve that passes through two or more points. Splines are generated with mathematical formulas. Two of the most common types of splines are Bezier curves and b-spline curves. 

split_backplane
A split backplane is often used to handle a large number of signals. Split backplane configurations will divide  bus connections between two motherboards (one on either side of the daughterboards). Using two motherboards shortens the path of connections to daughterboards and often improves performance.  See backplane for more information.

split_DNS
In a split DNS infrastructure, you create two zones for the same domain, one to be used by the internal network, the other used by the external network. Split DNS directs internal hosts to an internal domain name server for name resolution and external hosts are directed to an external domain name server for name resolution.

split_horizon
(split h&-rī´z&n) (n.) A routing technique that eliminates the chance of a routing scheme creating routing loops, effectively making routing more efficient. When a router in a network with only one data path receives a data packet, it does not send routing information back along the path on which the packet traveled (i.e., to an adjacent router); it only sends the information forward so that there is no possibility of the packet being routed back along the path it originally traveled.

Split_MultiLink_Trunking_SMLT
Split Multi-Link Trunking (SMLT) is an improvement over Multi-Link Trunking (MLT), a method of link aggregation that allows multiple Ethernet links to be aggregated together, and handled as a single logical trunk. SMLT is the splitting of member links in a normal MLT trunk from an end device across two devices. These devices synchronize state across an Inter-Switch Link (IST) such that they appear to the connecting device to be a single device (switch block) and prevent any packet duplication. SMLT provides enhanced resiliency with sub-second failover while operating transparently to end-devices. See also trunk.

split_screen
Division of the display screen into separate parts, each of which displays a different document, or different parts of the same document. 

split_tunneling
(split tun´&l-ing) (n.) The process of allowing a remote VPN user to access a public network, most commonly the Internet, at the same time that the user is allowed to access resources on the VPN. This method of network access enables the user to access remote devices, such as a networked printer, at the same time as accessing the public network.  An advantage of using split tunneling is that it alleviates bottlenecks and conserves bandwidth as Internet traffic does not have to pass through the VPN server. A disadvantage of this method is that it essentially renders the VPN vulnerable to attack as it is accessible through the public, non-secure network.

splog
Short for spam blog, it's a slang term used to describe blogs that are established only to promote affiliate Web sites in order to help those sites achieve a better search engine page ranking.

sploitz
Short for "exploits", sploitz is a slang term used to mean vulnerabilities in software that can be used by  hackers.

SPN
SPN, short for service principal name,  is the name by which a client uniquely identifies an instance of a service. If you install multiple instances of a service on computers throughout a forest, each instance must have its own SPN. A given service instance can have multiple SPNs if there are multiple names that clients might use for authentication. For example, an SPN always includes the name of the host computer on which the service instance is running, so a service instance might register an SPN for each name or alias of its host. [Source:   MSDN Library]

SPOF
Short for single point of failure, a generic phrase for any component of a system that upon failure will cause a malfunction in the entire system. A SPOF can be a hardware or electrical component or a software component.  Each time a system expands (e.g., adding a workstation to a network or adding a new application to a network of workstations) the number of places where an SPOF can occur also expands. Typically, systems with redundancy will still operate with an SPOF.

spoof
(v.) To fool. In networking, the term is used to describe a variety of ways in which hardware and software can be fooled. IP spoofing, for example, involves trickery that makes a message appear as if it came from an authorized IP address. Also see e-mail spoofing.
Spoofing is also used as a network management technique to reduce traffic. For example, most LAN protocols send out packets periodically to monitor the status of the network. LANs generally have enough bandwidth to easily absorb these network management packets. When computers are connected to the LAN over wide-area network (WAN) connections, however, this added traffic can become a problem. Not only can it strain the bandwidth limits of the WAN connection, but it can also be expensive because many WAN connections incur fees only when they are transmitting data. To reduce this problem, routers and other network devices can be programmed to spoof replies from the remote nodes. Rather than sending the packets to the remote nodes and waiting for a reply, the devices generate their own spoofedreplies.


spooler
A program that controls spooling -- putting jobs on a queue and taking them off one at a time. Most operating systems come with one or more spoolers, such as a print spooler for spooling documents. In addition, some applications include spoolers. Many word processors, for example, include their own print spooler.  A good print spooler should allow you to change the order of documents in the queue and to cancel specific print jobs. 

spooling
Acronym for simultaneous peripheral operations on-line, spooling refers to putting jobs in a buffer, a special area in memory or on a disk where a device can access them when it is ready. Spooling is useful because devices access dataat different rates. The buffer provides a waiting station where data can rest while the slower device catches up.
The most common spooling application is print spooling. In print spooling, documents are loaded into a buffer (usually an area on a disk), and then the printer pulls them off the buffer at its own rate. Because the documents are in a buffer where they can be accessed by the printer, you can perform other operations on the computer while the printing takes place in the background. Spooling also lets you place a number of print jobs on a queueinstead of waiting for each one to finish before specifying the next one.


sporn
A slang term used to describe e-mail spam specifically of adult content or of a pornographic nature. Sporn tends to be more aggressively marketed and deceitfully packaged than other types of spam.

sports_mode
In digital camera terminology, sports mode is a type of scene mode photographers can use to help take better sports or action shots. The sports mode will usually automatically set the camera to increase the shutter speed in order to freeze the action in the frame. Sports mode may also be called action mode on some digital cameras.
Other digital camera settings and shooting modes include:


Macro mode to focus on subjects close to the camera lens.
Movie mode to capture moving subjects in a video format.
In-camera red-eye fix to auto-correct any incidences red-eye.
Face detection to detect human faces and set the focus and appropriate exposure.
Landscape mode  for taking photos of a scene -- not a single object.
Portrait mode  for taking photos of a single subject.
Night mode  for taking photos in low-light situations or at night time.
Automatic exposure mode  automatically determines the correct exposure for pictures without any user input .

See also "Digital Cameras" in the  Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

spot_color
Refers to a method of specifying and printing colors in which each color is printed with its own ink. In contrast, process color printing uses four inks (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) to produce all other colors. Spot color printing is effective when the printed matter contains only one to three different colors, but it becomes prohibitively expensive for more colors.  Most desktop publishing and graphics applications allow you to specify spot colors for text and other elements. There are a number of color specification systems for specifying spot colors, but Pantone is the most widely used.   

spot_cooling
A type of computer system cooling where individual system components have their own cooling systems in place.

spotlight
Spotlight is the name used for Apple Computer's powerful search feature. Spotlight can be found on Mac OS X desktops and laptops as well as Apple iOS-powered devices like the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. Apple's Spotlight feature debuted with Mac OS X 10.4 "Tiger" in April 2005.
Spotlight can be accessed by clicking on the generic magnifying glass icon that is popularly employed to represent a computer or web search. Once a user begins typing in the Spotlight search field, apps, files and folders with matching names or meta data information will begin to appear in the search results area.
Spotlight Enhancements in iOS 8
In addition to its web and desktop search capabilities, Spotlight can also be used to perform additional functions such as basic calculations and looking up definitions for words. And on newer devices powered by iOS 8 (and later), Spotlight will take into account other factors such as context and location to provide more intelligent, personalized search results.

SPP
Abbreviated as SPP, a networking protocol that provides reliable transport of packets with flow control in environments where multiple transport connections are established. SPP uses destination ID reference numbers to identify the target end of a transport connection; sequence numbers to keep transmitted packets in the order in which they were sent; and acknowledge numbers that are assigned to the last packet in a sequence that a destination received properly to indicate that the transmission is complete and successful.

spreadsheet
A spreadsheet is a table of values arranged in rows and columns. Each value can have a predefined relationship to the other values. If you change one value, therefore, you may need to change other values as well.
Spreadsheet Applications
Spreadsheet applications (sometimes referred to simply as spreadsheets) are computer  programs that let you create and manipulate spreadsheets electronically. In a spreadsheet application, each value sits in a cell. You can define what type of data is in each cell and how different cells depend on one another. The relationships between cells are called formulas, and the names of the cells are called labels.
Entering Data
Once you have defined the cells and the formulas for linking them together, you can enter your data. You can then modify selectedvalues to see how all the other values change accordingly. This enables you to study various what-if scenarios.

sprite
A graphic image that can move within a larger graphic. Animation software that supports sprites enables the designer to develop independent animated images that can then be combined in a larger animation. Typically, each sprite has a set of rules that define how it moves and how it behaves if it bumps into another sprite or a static object. 

SPX
Short for Sequenced Packet Exchange, a transport layer protocol (layer 4 of the OSI Model) used in Novell Netware networks. The SPX layer sits on top of the IPX layer (layer 3) and provides connection-oriented services between two nodes on the network. SPX is used primarily by client/server applications.  Whereas the IPX protocol is similar to IP, SPX is similar to TCP. Together, therefore, IPX/SPX provides connection services similar to TCP/IP. 

spyware
(n.) Any software that covertly gathers user information through the user's Internet connection without his or her knowledge, usually for advertising purposes. Spyware applications are typically bundled as a hidden component of freeware or shareware programs that can be downloaded from the Internet; however, it should be noted that the majority of shareware and freeware applications do not come with spyware. Once installed, the spyware monitors user activity on the Internet and transmits that information in the background to someone else. Spyware can also gather information about e-mail addresses and even passwords and credit card numbers.
Spyware is similar to a Trojan horse in that users unwittingly install the product when they install something else. A common way to become a victim of spyware is to download certain peer-to-peer file swapping products that are available today.
Aside from the questions of ethics and privacy, spyware steals from the user by using the computer's memory resources and also by eating bandwidth as it sends information back to the spyware's home base via the user's Internet connection. Because spyware is using memory and system resources, the applications running in the background can lead to system crashes or general system instability.

SQL
Abbreviation of structured query language, and pronounced either see-kwell or as separate letters. SQL is a standardized query language for requesting information from a database. The original version called SEQUEL (structured English query language) was designed by an IBM research center in 1974 and 1975. SQL was first introduced as a commercial database systemin 1979 by Oracle Corporation.
Historically, SQL has been the favorite query language for database management systems running on minicomputers and mainframes. Increasingly, however, SQL is being supported by PC database systems because it supports distributed databases (databases that are spread out over several computer systems). This enables several users on a local-area network to accessthe same database simultaneously.
Although there are different dialects of SQL, it is nevertheless the closest thing to a standard query language that currently exists. In 1986, ANSI approved a rudimentary version of SQL as the official standard, but most versions of SQL since then have included many extensionsto the ANSI standard. In 1991, ANSI updated the standard. The new standard is known as SAG SQL.

SQL_injection
A form of attack on a database-driven Web site in which the attacker executes unauthorized SQL commands by taking advantage of insecure code on a system connected to the Internet, bypassing the firewall. SQL injection attacks are used to steal information from a database from which the data would normally not be available and/or to gain access to an organization's host computers through the computer that is hosting the database. SQL injection attacks typically are easy to avoid by ensuring that a system has strong input validation.

SQL_Server
Generically, any database management system (DBMS) that can respond to queries from client machines formatted in the SQL language. When capitalized, the term generally refers to either of two database management products from Sybase and Microsoft. Both companies offer client-server DBMS products called SQL Server.


squash_and_stretch
In 3D animation, squash and stretch is a technique that is applied to an animated or in-motion characters to give them a more exaggerated movement. Traditional cartoon animation contains a large amount of squash and stretch -- think of older cartoons where a cartoon character being hit on the head with a hammer would go through a lengthy series of movements as the effect of being hit.

squeeze_page
In Internet and online advertising vernacular, a squeeze page is a Web page that contains information that would interest the marketer's targeted readers. Squeeze pages are designed to obtain a reader's name and e-mail address information by encouraging users to opt-in to an e-mail list to receive more information about the topic. Marketers will collect the permission-based e-mail and information to follow up at a later date.   Currently, there is still some debate over the actual definition of a squeeze page. Some consider landing pages that offer additional hyperlinks to information as well as e-mail opt-in list sign-up to be a squeeze page, while others in the industry believe only those pages containing just an e-mail sign-up are considered a squeeze page.

SRAM
Short for static random access memory, and pronounced ess-ram. SRAM is a type of memory that is faster and more reliable than the more common DRAM (dynamic RAM). The term static is derived from the fact that it doesn't need to be refreshed like dynamic RAM.
While DRAM supports access times of about 60 nanoseconds, SRAM can give access times as low as 10 nanoseconds. In addition, its cycle time is much shorter than that of DRAM because it does not need to pause between accesses. Unfortunately, it is also much more expensive to produce than DRAM. Due to its high cost, SRAM is often used only as a memory cache.


SRM
Storage Resource Management (SRM) refers to software that manages storage from a capacity, utilization, policy and event-management perspective. This includes bill-back, monitoring, reporting and analytic capabilities that allow you to drill down for performance and availability.  Key elements of SRM include asset management, charge back, capacity management, configuration management, data and media migration, event management, performance and availability management, policy management, quota management, and media management.

SRS_Circle_Surround
SRS Circle Surround enables audio professionals to encode up to 6.1 channels of discrete program material for transmission via any two-channel medium, such as broadcast television or radio (including digital) or two-channel Internet streams. Circle Surround-encoded material can also be stored for playback over two-channel mediums such as VHS, PC and console games, DVDs and CDs. Circle Surround-encoded material is backward compatible with all existing playback formats from mono to 5.1 channel surround sound decoding.

SS7
Short for Signaling System 7, a telecommunications protocol defined by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) as a way to offload PSTN data traffic congestion onto a wireless or wireline digital broadband network.   SS7 is characterized by high-speed circuit switching and out-of-band signaling using Service Switching (SSPs), Signal Transfer Points (STPs), and Service Control Points (SCPs) (collectively referred to as signaling points, or SS7 nodes). Out-of-band signaling is signaling that does not take place over the same path as the data transfer (or conversation)--a separate digital channel is created (called a signaling link), where messages are exchanged between network elements at 56 or 64 kilobit per second.   SS7 architecture is set up in a way so that any node could exchange signaling with any other SS7-capable node, not just signaling between switches that are directly connected.   The SS7 network and protocol are used for:   - basic call setup, management, and tear down  - wireless services such as personal communications services (PCS), wireless roaming, and mobile subscriber authentication  - local number portability (LNP)  - toll-free (800/888) and toll (900) wireline services  - enhanced call features such as call forwarding, calling party name/number display, and three-way calling  - efficient and secure worldwide telecommunications 

SSA
Abbreviated as SSA, Serial Storage Architecture  is an open industry-standard interface that provides a high-performance, serial interconnect technology used to connect disk devices and host adapters. SSA serializes the SCSI data set and using loop architecture that requires only two wires: transmit and receive. The SSA interface also supports full-duplex, so it can transmit and receive data simultaneously at full speed.

SSADM
Short for Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method, a set of standards developed in the early 1980s for systems analysis and application design widely used for government computing projects in the United Kingdom. SSADM uses a combination of text and diagrams throughout the whole life cycle of a systemdesign, from the initial design idea to the actual physical design of the application.
SSADM uses a combination of three techniques:

Logical Data Modeling -- the process of identifying, modeling and documenting the data requirements of the system being designed. The data is separated into entities (things about which a business needs to record information) and relationships(the associations between the entities.
Data Flow Modeling -- the process of identifying, modeling and documenting how data moves around an information system. Data Flow Modeling examines processes (activities that transform data from one form to another), data stores (the holding areas for data), external entities (what sends data into a system or receives data from a system, and data flows(routes by which data can flow).
Entity Behavior Modeling -- the process of identifying, modeling and documenting the events that affect each entity and the sequence in which these events occur.

Each of these three system models provides a different viewpoint of the same system, and each viewpoint is required to form a complete model of the system being designed. The three techniques are cross-referenced against each other to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the whole application.
