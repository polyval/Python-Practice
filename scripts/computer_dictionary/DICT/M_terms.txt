M
(1) When used to describe data storage, 1,048,576 (2 to the 20th power) bytes. Megabyte is frequently abbreviated as M or MB.
(2) When used to describe data transfer rates, as in MBps, it refers to one million bytes.
 

m_commerce
Short for mobile e-commerce, m-commerce is the term used to describe the growing trend of using networks that interface with wireless devices, such as laptops, handheld computers or mobile phones to initiate or complete online electronic commerce transactions. May also be seen written as M-commerce or mcommerce.
See also e-commerce.

M_JPEG2000
The M-JPEG2000 codec (MJ2K) is a  video adaptation of the JPEG2000 standard. M-JPEG2000 will treat a video stream as a series of still photos, compressing each individually. This codec is often used when high compression and interoperability are necessary. This video codec registers into the Windows collection of multimedia drivers.

m0n0wall
An embedded FreeBSD-based  firewall software product that was first developed by Manuel Kasper in 2002. It runs on almost any x86-based PC with a Pentium-compatible processor, at least 64 MB of RAM and at least two supported network controllers. No hard disk is required; a USB flash drive or even a CD-ROM plus a floppy disk (for very old machines) suffice. The most recent releases of m0n0wall have updated the base system to FreeBSD 6, improved support for new WLAN cards as well as WPA, SIP proxy, and also supports ISPsec tunnels to dynamic endpoints.

M3U
The  file extension for playlists created in some media players including Winamp. The M3U file is a text file that that contains information about the location of each media file selected for the playlist.

Mac
(1) Short for Media Access Control. See MAC address or MAC layer. 
(2) When spelled Mac, the brand name and registered trademark for a line of computers from Apple Inc. See under Macintosh computer. 
(3) Short for Mandatory Access Control. 

MAC_address
Short for Media Access Control address, a hardware address that uniquely identifies each node of a network. In IEEE 802 networks, the Data Link Control (DLC) layer of the OSI Reference Model is divided into two sub-layers: the  Logical Link Control (LLC) layer and the Media Access Control (MAC) layer. The MAC layer interfaces directly with the network medium. Consequently, each different type of network medium requires a different MAC layer.
On networks that do not conform to the IEEE 802 standards but do conform to the OSI Reference Model, the node address is called the  Data Link Control (DLC) address.
How to Find a MAC Address
To display your MAC address on a Windows NT/2000/2003/XP/Visa computer:


Click START
Go to ACCESSORIES
Select Command Prompt
Type: (no quotes) "ipconfig /all"

In the "ipconfig /all" results look for the adapter you want to find the MAC address of. The MAC address is the number located next to "Physical Address" in the list.


mac_app_store
A part of Apple's App Store that facilitates finding, purchasing and downloading software applications for Mac OS X personal computers. The Mac App Store can only be accessed by PCs using Mac OS X Snow Leopard, Mac OS X Lion or a later version of Mac OS X.

MAC_layer
The Media Access Control Layer is one of two sublayers that make up the Data Link Layer of the OSI model. The MAC layer is responsible for moving data packets to and from one Network Interface Card (NIC) to another across a shared channel.
See a breakdown of the seven OSI layers in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.
The MAC sublayer uses MAC protocols to ensure that signals sent from different stations across the same channel don't collide.

Mac_OS
The official name of the Macintosh operating system. Earlier versions were called System x.x, where x.x were the version numbers. With the release of Mac OS 8, however, Apple dropped the System moniker.  

Mac_OS_X
(Pronounced Mac Oh-Ess Ten) The latest operating system for Apple's Macintosh computers. Mac OS X is a development platform that supports multiple development technologies including UNIX, Java, the proprietary Cocoa and Carbon runtime environments, and a host of open source, Web, scripting, database and development technologies.The Mac OS X Mountain Lion update (v10.8) is the most recent release of the Mac OS X operating system, following earlier updates for the OS: Cheetah (v10.0), Puma (v10.1), Jaguar (v10.2), Panther (v10.3), Tiger (v10.4), Leopard (v10.5), Snow Leopard (v10.6) and Lion (v10.7).

mAC3dec
A free Mac audio conversion  utility, that enables users to save one audio format to another, for example .ac3 to .aiff.

macbuntu
Macbuntu is an open source operating system fork of the Linux-based Ubuntu OS that features a Mac OS X-inspired desktop shell.  Macbuntu derives its Mac OS X look and feel from the Mac OS X Transformation Pack, which can also be used in other operating systems based on Debian / GTK to provide the same Mac OS X-inspired shell interface.  

macdefender
MACDefender, or Mac Defender, is a Trojan horse that first appeared in early 2011, masquerading as an antivirus program in an attempt to get users to share their credit card information over an unsecured site. The MACDefender rogue antivirus software targets Mac users via a phishing scam that redirects the users from legitimate sites to fake sites that make the user think their computer has been infected with a virus.
If a user were to click on the bogus link and install the MACDefender software, he or she would be presented with a professional-looking but ultimately fake antivirus program. The MACDefender malware installation could also begin automatically if Safari’s "open safe file after downloading" option had been selected. 
Once installed, MACDefender will periodically open pornographic sites in an attempt to make users believe they have a virus on their computer and as a result need to purchase the "registered version" of the MACDefender software with a credit card.

machine_address
Same as absolute address.  

machine_binding
Usually a part of software licensing or digital media distribution that prohibits the software from being used on more than one physical computer system or machine. Users who upgrade their systems or make major changes to it may have difficulty keeping their rights if enough changes are detected in the system.

machine_dependent
Refers to a software application that runs only on a particular type of computer. Programs that run on a variety of different types of computers are called machine independent.  Almost all programs have some machine dependencies (that is, they run somewhat differently on different types of computers), but the degree of independence can vary widely. Machine-independent programs give you more flexibility: if you buy a new type of computer, you can continue using the same software package instead of learning a new one. On the other hand, machine-dependent programs often take advantage of special hardware features of a particular computer, making the programs faster.  Another term for machine dependent is device dependent, but whereas machine dependent usually refers to the computer, device dependent can refer to a dependency on any device, like a printer. 

machine_independent
Able to run on a variety of computers.  

machine_language
Machine language is the lowest-level programming language (except for computers that utilize programmable microcode). Machine languages are the only languages understood by computers.
Why Humans Don't Use Machine Language
While easily understood by computers, machine languages are almost impossible for humans to use because they consist entirely of numbers. Programmers, therefore, use either a high-level programming language or an assembly language. An assembly language contains the same instructions as a machine language, but the instructions and variables have names instead of being just numbers.


machine-learning
In computer science machine learning refers to a type of data analysis that uses algorithms that learn from data. It is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. This enables computers to find data within data without human intervention.
What is important to know about machine learning is that data is being used to make predictions, not code. Data is dynamic so machine learning allows the system to learn and evolve with experience and the more data that is analyzed.
Origins of the Phrase Machine Learning
Machine learning was first defined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Samuel defined machine learning as a "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed".

machine_readable
In a form that a computer can accept. Machine-readable data includes files stored on disk or tape, or data that comes from a device connected to a computer. Even typewritten pages can be considered machine-readable if you have an optical character recognition (OCR) system.  

Machinima
Machinima is a form of filmmaking that uses computer game technology to shoot films in the virtual reality using a game engine.

Macintosh_computer
A popular model of computer made by Apple Computer. Introduced in 1984, the Macintosh features a graphical user interface (GUI) that utilizes windows, icons, and a mouse to make it relatively easy for novices to use the computer productively. Rather than learning a complex set of commands, you need only point to a selection on a menu and click a mouse button.
Moreover, the GUI is embedded into the operating system. This means that all applications that run on a Macintosh computer have a similar user interface. Once a user has become familiar with one application, he or she can learn new applications relatively easily. The success of the Macintosh GUI heralded a new age of graphics-based applications and operating systems. The Windows interface copies many features from the Mac.
There are many different Macintosh models, with varying degrees of speed and power. All models are available in many different configurations. All models since 1994 are based on the PowerPC microprocessor.

macro
(1) A symbol, name, or key that represents a list of commands, actions, or keystrokes. Many programs allow you to create macros so that you can enter a single character or word to perform a whole series of actions. Suppose, for example, that you are editing a file and want to indent every third line five spaces. If your word processor supports macros, you can create one that consists of the following keystrokes:
Move Cursor to Beginning of Line
Move Cursor Down 1 Line

macro_mode
A setting on a digital camera that enables users to focus on subjects close to the camera lens. Macro mode is commonly used to photographing flowers, insects and other small items that you want a close-up view of. The distance you can shoot in macro mode from will differ between cameras. Some may be able to focus when the lens is less than an inch away from the subject, while others may be an inch or further.
Other digital camera settings and shooting modes include:


Sports mode to shoot sports and other types of action shots.
Movie mode to capture moving subjects in a video format.
In-camera red-eye fix to auto-correct any incidences red-eye.
Face detection to detect human faces and set the focus and appropriate exposure.
Landscape mode  for taking photos of a scene -- not a single object.
Portrait mode  for taking photos of a single subject.
Night mode  for taking photos in low-light situations or at night time.
Automatic exposure mode  automatically determines the correct exposure for pictures without any user input .

See also "The Digital Camera Picture" in  Webopedia's Quick Reference section.

macro_virus
A type of computer virus that is encoded as a macro embedded in a document. Many applications, such as Microsoft Word and Excel, support powerful macro languages. These applications allow you to embed a macro in a document, and have the macro execute each time the document is opened.  According to some estimates, 75% of all viruses today are macro viruses. Once a macro virus gets onto your machine, it can embed itself in all future documents you create with the application. Antivirus programs can protect your system against most macro viruses, although new ones are always being created that slip by the antivirus filters.  

macrobend
In fiber optic transmissions, macrobend is a large visible bend in the optical fiber that can cause extrinsic attenuation, a reduction of optical power in the glass.  Contrast with microbend.

Macroblock
Stand-alone frames in pictures, called I-frames divided into 8x8 block of nonoverlapping pixels. Four of these blocks arranged into a bigger 16x16 block are called a macroblock.

macrocell
A macrocell provides the largest area of coverage within a mobile network. The antennas for macrocells can be mounted on ground-based masts, rooftops or other existing structures. They must be positioned at a height that is not obstructed by terrain or buildings. Macrocells provide radio coverage over varying distances depending on the frequency used, the number of calls made and the physical terrain. Macrocell base stations have a typical power output in tens of watts. [Source: MOA]

macromolecule
A large complex molecule formed from simpler molecules.

Macrovision
A company that sells copy protection products. Macrovision Corp. has developed and sold copy protection products for VHS, and later a system for DVDs which prevented the copying of DVDs to VHS. Macrovision also offers copy protection solutions for software license tracking, and copy protection for computer games, as well as others. The video encoding technology found on DVDs is also called Macrovision, named after the company.

MacVCD
A popular VCD video player for the Mac OS X operating system. MacVCD supports VCD, SVCD, AVI, DivX,  MPEG, video, and Quicktimemovies. The program is distributed by The Mireth Technology Corporation.


MAE
Short for Metropolitan Area Ethernet, a Network Access Point (NAP) where Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can connect with each other. The original MAE was set up by a company called MFS and is based in Washington, D.C. Later, MFS built another one in Silicon Valley, dubbed MAE-West. In addition to the MAEs from MFS, there are many other NAPs. Although MAE refers really only to the NAPs from MFS, the two terms are often used interchangeably. 

Magellan
A Web directory published by the McKinley Group, now owned by Excite, Inc. Magellan takes its name from Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer who navigated the Strait of Magellan in 1520. 

magnetic_drum
A direct-access, or random-access, storage device. A magnetic drum, also referred to as drum, is a metal cylinder coated with magnetic iron-oxide material on which data and programs can be stored. Magnetic drums were once used as a primary storage device but have since been implemented as auxiliary storage devices.  The tracks on a magnetic drum are assigned to channels located around the circumference of the drum, forming adjacent circular bands that wind around the drum. A single drum can have up to 200 tracks. As the drum rotates at a speed of up to 3,000 rpm, the device's read/write heads deposit magnetized spots on the drum during the write operation and sense these spots during a read operation. This action is similar to that of a magnetic tape or disk drive.  Unlike some disk packs, the magnetic drum cannot be physically removed. The drum is permanently mounted in the device. Magnetic drums are able to retrieve data at a quicker rate than tape or disk devices but are not able to store as much data as either of them.

magneto_optical_MO_drive
A type of disk drive that combines magnetic disk technologies with optical technologies, such as those used in CD-ROMs. An MO disk drive is designed so that an inserted disk will be exposed to a magnet on the label side and to the laser beam on the opposite side.

mAh
Abbreviation for Milliampere-hour, which is how batteries are rated for capacity power. The higher the mAh rating, the more powerful the batteries.

massive_array_of_idle_disks
In storage terminology a massive array of idle disks, or MAID as it is abbreviated, is a technology that uses a large group of hard disk drives, hundreds or even thousands, with only those drives that are needed actively spinning at any given time. MAID is a storage system solution that reduces both wear on the drives and also reduces power consumption. Because only specific disks spin at a given time, what is not in use is literally a massive array of idle disks, which also means the system produces less heat than other large storage systems.
One type of MAID is called the Copan array (Copan Systems Inc.). The Copan array treats drives in the array similar to a tape library (VTL) where only what is needed is actually powered. A Copan array can contain hundreds of terabytes of disks which share supply, controller, and cabinet.  See also disk array.

mail_exchange_record
Short for mail exchange record, an entry in a domain name database that identifies the mail server that is responsible for handling e-mails for that domain name.  When more than one MX record is entered for any single domain name that is using more than one mail server, the MX record can be prioritized with a preference number that indicates the order in which the mail servers should be used. This enables the use of primary and backup mail servers.

mail_merge
)A feature supported by many word processors that enables you to generate form letters. To use a mail-merge system, you first store a set of information, like a list of names and addresses, in one file. In another file, you write a letter, substituting special symbols in place of names and addresses (or whatever other information will come from the first file). For example, you might write:
Dear NAME: Our records show that your address is:STREET CITY, STATE ZIP If this is incorrect,...
When you execute the merge command, the word processor automatically generates letters by replacing symbols (NAME, STREET, CITY, STATE, and ZIP) in the second file with the appropriate data from the first file

mail_relay
Often referred to as an e-mail server, a device and/or program that routes an e-mail to the correct destination. Mail relays are typically used within local networks to transmit e-mails among local users. (For example, all of the student and faculty e-mail of a college campus.) Mail relays are particularly useful in e-mail aliasing where multiple e-mail addresses are used but the mail relay forwards all messages to the specified e-mail addresses to one single address.
A mail relay is different than an open relay, where an e-mail server processes a mail message that that neither originates or ends with a user that is within the server��s local domain (i.e., local IP range).

mailbox
An area in memory or on a storage device where e-mail is placed. In e-mail systems, each user has a private mailbox. When the user receives e-mail, the mail system automatically puts it in the mailbox.  The mail system allows you to scan mail that is in your mailbox, copy it to a file, delete it, print it, or forward it to another user. If you want to save mail, it is a good idea to copy it to a file, because files tend to be more stable than mailboxes. Also see Why E-Mails Bounce in the Did You Know section of Webopedia. 

Mailbox_store
A Mailbox Management feature found in Microsoft Exchange 2000 and later versions. If you have multiple Exchange Servers and Mailbox Stores, you can select the Server and Mailbox Store on which the mailbox will be created. It is possible to move Mailboxes between different Servers and Mailboxes after Mailbox creation.

mailing_list
A list of e-mail addresses identified by a single name, such as mail-list@sandybay.com. When an e-mail message is sent to the mailing list name, it is automatically forwarded to all the addresses in the list.  Most e-mail clients support mailing lists, which enables you to broadcast e-mail messages to groups that you define. In addition, there are mailing list servers that manage centralized mailing lists for groups of users.  Also see Why E-Mails Bounce in the Did You Know section of Webopedia. 

mailing_list_server
A server that manages mailing lists for groups of users. Two of the most popular mailing list server systems for the Internet are Listserv and Majordomo.  

main_distribution_frame
See MDF.

main_memory
Refers to physical memory that is internal to the computer. The word main is used to distinguish it from external mass storage devices such as disk drives. Another term for main memory is RAM.
The computer can manipulate only data that is in main memory. Therefore, every program you execute and every file you access must be copied from a storage device into main memory. The amount of main memory on a computer is crucial because it determines how many programs can be executed at one time and how much data can be readily available to a program.
Because computers often have too little main memory to hold all the data they need, computer engineers invented a technique called swapping, in which portions of data are copied into main memory as they are needed. Swapping occurs when there is no room in memory for needed data. When one portion of data is copied into memory, an equal-sized portion is copied (swapped) out to make room.

MainConcept_MPEG_Encoder
A program used to convert video data into MPEG1 or MPEG2 formats such as Video CD, Super Video CD and DVD. MainConcept MPEG Encoder enables users to select their own level of compression, and also offers a number of settings for adjusting both video and audio streams.

mainframe
A very large and expensive computer capable of supporting hundreds, or even thousands, of users simultaneously. In the hierarchy that starts with a simple microprocessor (in watches, for example) at the bottom and moves to supercomputers at the top, mainframes are just below supercomputers. In some ways, mainframes are more powerful than supercomputers because they support more simultaneous programs. But supercomputers can execute a single program faster than a mainframe. The distinction between small mainframes and minicomputers is vague, depending really on how the manufacturer wants to market its machines.


Majordomo
A free mailing list server that runs under UNIX. When e-mail is addressed to a Majordomo mailing list, it is automatically broadcast to everyone on the list. The result is similar to a newsgroup or forum, except that the messages are transmitted as e-mail and are therefore available only to individuals on the list.  Another popular mailing list server is LISTSERV.  

malicious_active_content
A type of malware that uses common, dynamic scripting languages (e.g. Java,  Javascript, Active X, or Visual Basic). Vulnerabilities in the scripting language are exploited to carry  malicious code, which could be downloaded through a  Web browser and executed on a local system without the user's knowledge or consent. Malicious active content can be used for many criminal activities, including to deliver viruses and worms, send e-mail, record information from the local user, or to redirect users or content. Active content is also called mobile code.
See also active content.

malicious_code
Malicious code is the term used to describe any code in any part of a software system or script that is intended to cause undesired effects, security breaches or damage to a system. Malicious code describes a broad category of system security terms that includes attack scripts, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, backdoors, and malicious active content.

malvertising
(mal' ver tiz' ing) (n.) Malicious online advertising, typically performed by masking malicious computer code with seemingly harmless online advertisements. The advertisements may lead to harmful or deceptive content or may directly infect a victim's computer with malicious software (malware) that can damage data, steal personal information or even bring the user's computer under the control of a remote operator.

malware
(mal´wãr) (n.) Short for malicious software, malware refers to software designed specifically to damage or disrupt a system, such as a virus or a Trojan horse.
Also see The Difference Between a Virus, Worm and Trojan Horse  in the Did You Know? section of Webopedia.


mam-mobile-application-management
Mobile Application Management (MAM) is a term that refers to software and services used to secure, manage and distribute mobile applications used in enterprise settings on mobile devices like smartphones and tablet computers.
Mobile Application Management can apply to company-owned mobile devices as well as BYOD ("Bring Your Own Devices"). MAM solutions typically offer a variety of capabilities and services, including application delivery and software licensing, application configuration, app authorization, usage tracking and application lifecycle management (ALM).
Mobile Application Management vs. Mobile Device Management
MAM shares some characteristics with Mobile Device Management (MDM), but whereas MDM primarily involves protecting and securing mobile device use within an enterprise – as well as the use of applications on these devices – Mobile Application Management's sole focus is on securing sensitive enterprise apps and their data.

Mambo
Mambo is a Content Management System (CMS) that can be used for for simple Web sites to complex corporate applications. Mambo is released under the GNU General Public license. Mambo is aimed more squarely at corporate Web sites or sites for small to medium businesses, families or personal sites. See also Joomla.Learn more about  Open Source in Webopedia's "Did You Know...?" section.

MAMP
Short for Macintosh, Apache, MySQL, Perl/Python/PHP MAMP is a variation to the LAMP stack. MAMP uses Macintosh as the operating system, Apache as the Web server, MySQL as the database server, and PHP as a module for the Web server. Perl or Python may be substituted for PHP.  See LAMP. Learn more about  Open Source in Webopedia's "Did You Know...?" section.

MAN
Short for Metropolitan Area Network, a data network designed for a town or city. In terms of geographic breadth, MANs are larger than local-area networks (LANs), but smaller than wide-area networks (WANs).

Manchester_encoding
In data transmission Manchester encoding is a method of transmitting bits that allows the receiver to easily synchronize with the sender. Manchester encoding splits each bit period into two, and ensures that there is always a transition between the signal levels in the middle of each bit. In Manchester encoding "1" is transmitted as 0 in the first half of the clock and 1 in the second half of the clock. And "0" is transmitted as 1 in the first half of the clock and 0 in the second half of the clock.

Mandatory_Access_Control
In computer security Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is a type of access control in which only the administrator manages the access controls. The administrator defines the usage and access policy, which cannot be modified or changed by users, and the policy will indicate who has access to which programs and files. MAC is most often used in systems where priority is placed on confidentiality.  Contrast with Discretionary Access Control (DAC) which is determined by the user with permission.

mandelbug
In computer programming, mandelbug is a classification of an unusual software bug that is so complex that its behavior appears chaotic or there is no practical solution to fix it. An examplele of this type of bug would be a fundamental design flaw in an operating system. The mandelbug was named after Professor Benoit Mandelbrot, the innovator of fractal mathematics.

Mandriva
Mandriva Linux, formerly called Mandrake Linux, is a full  Linux distribution created by Mandriva. It was initially was based on Red Hat Linux and KDE.

manual_submission
Adding your Web site URL and details to search engines individually by hand, rather than using a link submission service or software.

map
(n.) A file showing the structure of a program after it has been compiled. The map file lists every variable in the program along with its memory address. This information is useful for debugging purposes. Normally a compiler will not produce a map file unless you explicitly ask for it by specifying the appropriate compiler option.  (v.) (1) To make logical connections between two entities. Because programs cannot translate directly from human concepts to computer numbers, they translate incrementally through a series of layers. Each layer contains the same amount of information as the layer above but in a form somewhat closer to the form that the computer understands. This activity of translating from one layer to another is called mapping.  The term map is often used to describe programming languages. For example, C is an efficient programming language because it maps well onto the machine language. What this means is that it is relatively easy to translate from the C language to machine languages.  (2) To copy a set of objects from one place to another while preserving the objects' organization. For example, when loaded, programs on a disk are mapped into memory. Graphics images in memory are mapped onto a display screen. (3)In computer animation map is a technique or tool used by the programmer to add texture (material) and realism to 3D models.)

MAPI

MARA
Short for Mobile Augmented Reality Applications MARA is a Nokia research project that uses camera-equipped mobile devices as platforms for sensor-based, video see-through mobile  Augmented Reality. The MARA prototype application uses accelerometers in all three axes to determine orientation, a tilt compensated compass for heading, and GPS for positioning. If the absolute location and orientation of a camera is known, along with the properties of the lens, it's possible to determine exactly what parts of the scene are viewed by the camera.  See also Augmented Reality.

margins
In word processing, the strips of white space around the edge of the paper. Most word processors allow you to specify the widths of margins. The wider the left and right margins, the narrower the page. The wider the top and bottom margins, the shorter the page.  If your word processor performs word wrap, it will automatically adjust the length of the lines when you change the widths of the margins.  

Mariposa
The name of a malicious botnet. Dubbed Mariposa, this widespread malware campaign managed to infiltrate more than 13 million PCs and more than half of the world's 1,000-largest companies.   Three men, who called themselves the "Nightmare Days Team" and dubbed their botnet projects "Mariposa," were arrested by Spanish authorities in February 2010 after a yearlong investigation by law enforcement agencies and security software vendors Panda Security.  The Mariposa �� the Spanish word for butterfly �� botnet was shut down on Dec. 23, 2009 after operating largely unhindered for almost a year. Mariposa accessed more than 13 million PCs in all, making it one of the largest and most destructive botnets in history.  Adapted from "Crackdown on Mariposa: Botnet Infected 13 Million PCs" on eSecurity Planet.

marketing_automation

markup_language
Markup languages are designed for the processing, definition and presentation of text. The language specifies code for formatting, both the layout and style, within a text file. The code used to specify the formatting are called tags. HTMLis a an example of a widely known and used markup language.


marquee
(1) On web pages, a scrolling area of text. Starting with Version 2, Microsoft Internet Explorer supports a special <MARQUEE> tag for creating these areas. Netscape Navigator, however, does not support this tag. You can also create marquees with Java applets and Dynamic HTML.  (2) In graphics software, a sizable and movable frame that identifies a selected portion of a bit-mapped image. The marquee frame can be rectangular in shape or, in some cases, irregular. A lasso tool, for example, enables you to select all contiguous portions of an image that share the same color.  The marquee frame is usually displayed with a flashing dashed line. In fact, that explains the origin of the name, since the dashed lines look a little like the flashing lights around a theater entrance, which is also called a marquee.  

marshmallow
Marshmallow is the official Android codename for the upcoming 6.0 update of the open source Android mobile operating system. Marshmallow was first announced at Google I/O in May 2015 as the Android  M release, and the mobile OS is expected to make its official debut in October or November 2015 as the successor to the "Lollipop" Android 5.0 release.
Unlike its predecessors, Android Marshmallow initially lacked a dessert-themed moniker when it was first announced, partly to build anticipation around the software. Google did however unveil the Marshmallow name on August 17th, 2015, when it officially released the Android 6.0 SDK and the third software preview of Marshmallow for Nexus devices.
What's New in Marshmallow 
Android Marshmallow refines the enhanced Material Design user interface that first debuted in Lollipop, and it adds support for the new Android Pay system to go along with better app management, improved battery life and built-in support for fingerprint authentication and USB Type-C.

A mash-up, for example, could overlay traffic data from one source on the Internet over maps from Yahoo, Microsoft, Google or any content provider. The term mash-up comes from the hip-hop music practice of mixing two or more songs.  This capability to mix and match data and applications from multiple sources into one dynamic entity is considered by many to represent the promise of the Web service standard (also referred to as on-demand computing). Also see Understanding "Web Services" in the "Did You Know...?" section of Webopedia.

mashboard
Also called real-time dashboard, a mashboard is a  Web 2.0 buzzword that is used to describe analytic mash-ups that allow businesses to create or add components that may analyze and present data, look up inventory, accept orders, and other tasks without ever having to access the system that carries out the transaction.
Also see Understanding "Web Services" in the "Did You Know...?" section of Webopedia. 

mask

mask_pitch
In color monitors, the distance between holes in the shadow mask. The mask pitch is essentially the same as the dot pitch, but it's measured on the mask rather than on the screen. The mask pitch is generally about.30 millimeters (mm). The tighter the mask pitch, the sharper the image.  

masquerade_attack
In system security masquerade attack is a type of attack in which one system assumes the identity of another. See also spoof.

mass_storage
Refers to various techniques and devices for storing large amounts of data. The earliest storage devices were punched paper cards, which were used as early as 1804 to control silk-weaving looms. Modern mass storage devices include all types of disk drives and tape drives. Mass storage is distinct from memory, which refers to temporary storage areas within the computer. Unlike main memory, mass storage devices retain data even when the computer is turned off.  The main types of mass storage are:  floppy disks : Relatively slow and have a small capacity, but they are portable, inexpensive, and universal. hard disks : Very fast and with more capacity than floppy disks, but also more expensive. Some hard disk systems are portable (removable cartridges), but most are not. optical disks : Unlike floppy and hard disks, which use electromagnetism to encode data, optical disk systems use a laser to read and write data. Optical disks have very large storage capacity, but they are not as fast as hard disks. In addition, the inexpensive optical disk drives are read-only. Read/write varieties are expensive.  tapes  : Relatively inexpensive and can have very large storage capacities, but they do not permit random access of data.   Mass storage is measured in kilobytes (1,024 bytes), megabytes (1,024 kilobytes), gigabytes (1,024 megabytes) and terabytes (1,024 gigabytes).  Mass storage is sometimes called auxiliary storage.  See the "Removable Storage Reference" in the  Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

master_data
Also called reference data master data is any information that is considered to play a key role in the core operation of a business. Master data may include data about clients and customers, employees, inventory, suppliers, analytics and more.

mate
MATE is a fork of the GNOME 2 desktop environment that offers compatibility with the newer GNOME 3 while retaining the look and feel of the earlier GNOME release. MATE's compatibility with GNOME 3 enables the two desktop environments to run on the same system.
The Linux Mint distribution of Linux includes MATE in version 12 as a desktop environment option, but the core developers of Linux Mint have largely shifted focus to their own desktop environment vision known as Cinnamon, which is a fork of GNOME 3.

material
A texture applied to an object which will display a realistic look when rendered. For example, applying a grainy wood material to a tree trunk and a green grassy or leafy material to the tree top will make a realistic tree when rendered in 3D. The material is what add the realism to the 3D object.


mathematical_expression
Any expression that represents a numeric value.  

MathML
Short for Mathematical Markup Language, an XML application for describing mathematical notations and capturing both its structure (including its complex two-dimensional symbolic notations) and its content and enabling that structure and content to be communicated over the Web. To communicate mathematics over the Web, it is essential to have a system that facilitates the processing, searching and indexing of data, and the reuse of that data in other mathematical applications and contexts.

matte_paper
Unlike glossy paper, matte paper produces nice quality prints but does not have that vibrant color finish. Matte paper is not vulnerable to being marred by fingerprints and it produces a non-glare photo. Types of matte inkjet paper include photo quality matte, premium (professional) grade, double-sided matte, and semi-matte.


MAU
(1) Short for Media Access Unit, an Ethernet transceiver.
(2) Short for Multistation Access Unit (also abbreviated as MSAU), a token-ring network device that physically connects network computers in a star topology while retaining the logical ring structure. One of the problems with the token-ring topology is that a single non-operating node can break the ring. The MAU solves this problem because it has the ability to short out non-operating nodes and maintain the ring structure. A MAU is a special type of hub.

MB
(1) When spelled MB, short for megabyte (1,000,000 or 1,048,576 bytes, depending on the context).  (2) When spelled Mb, short for megabit.

Mbone
Short for Multicast Backbone on the Internet, MBone is an extension to the Internet to support IP multicasting -- two-way transmission of data between multiple sites. The TCP/IP protocol used by the Internet divides messages into packets and sends each packet independently. Packets can travel different routes to their destination, which means that they can arrive in any order and with sizable delays between the first and last packets. In addition, each recipient of the data requires that separate packets be sent from the source to the destination. This works fine for static information, such as text and graphics, but it doesn't work well for real-time audio and video.  With Mbone, a single packet can have multiple destinations and isn't split up until the last possible moment. This means that it can pass through several routers before it needs to be divided to reach its final destinations. This leads to much more efficient transmission and also ensures that packets reach multiple destinations at roughly the same time.  The MBone is an experiment to upgrade the Internet to handle live multimedia messages. MBone servers have special Class D IP addresses. As of March 1997, there were more than 3,000 MBone servers on the Internet.  The Mbone was developed by Steve Deering at Xerox PARC and adopted by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in March 1992.   

Mbps
(1) When spelled Mbps, short for megabits  per second, a measure of data transfer speed (a megabit is equal to one million bits). Network transmissions, for example, are generally measured in Mbps.
(2) When spelled MBps, short for megabytes per second.
 

MBR
Short for Master Boot Record, a small program that is executed when a computer boots up. Typically, the MBR resides on the first sector of the hard disk. The program begins the boot process by looking up the partition table to determine which partition to use for booting. It then transfers program control to the boot sector of that partition, which continues the boot process. In DOS and Windows systems, you can create the MBR with the FDISK /MBR command.  An MBR virus is a common type of virus that replaces the MBR with its own code. Since the MBR executes every time a computer is started, this type of virus is extremely dangerous. MBR viruses normally enter a system through a floppy disk that is installed in the floppy drive when the computer is started up. Even if the floppy disk is not bootable, it can infect the MBR. 

Microsoft_Certified_Desktop_Support_Technician_MCDST

MCU
Short for multipoint control unit, a device in videoconferencing that connects two or more audiovisual terminals together into one single videoconference call. The MCU collects information about the capabilities of the systems at each of the videoconference endpoints and sets the conference at the lowest common denominator so that everyone can participate.

md5
An algorithm created in 1991 by Professor Ronald Rivest that is used to create digital signatures. It is intended for use with 32 bit machines and is safer than the MD4 algorithm, which has been broken. MD5 is a one-way hash function, meaning that it takes a message and converts it into a fixed string of digits, also called a message digest.   When using a one-way hash function, one can compare a calculated message digest against the message digest that is decrypted with a public key to verify that the message hasn't been tampered with. This comparison is called a "hashcheck."   

MDA
Abbreviation of monochrome display adapter, an old monochrome video standard for PCs. MDA supports high-resolution monochrome text but does not support graphics or colors. The resolution for text is 720 by 350 pixels.  

MDF
Short for main distribution frame, a cable rack that interconnects and manages the telecommunications wiring between itself and any number of IDFs. Unlike an IDF, which connects internal lines to the MDF, the MDF connects private or public lines coming into a building with the internal network. For example, an enterprise that encompasses a building with several floors may have one centralized MDF on the first floor and one IDF on each of the floors that is connected to the MDF.

MDI
(1) See Multiple Document Interface.  (2) See medium dependent interface.

MDIX
Short for medium dependent interface crossover (the "X" representing "crossover"), an Ethernet port connection that allows networked end stations (i.e., PCs or workstations) to connect to each other using a null-modem, or crossover, cable.  Compare with MDI.  MDIX is also referred to as an MDIX port.

mobile_device_management
MDM is short for mobile device management.
What is Mobile Device Management (MDM)?
Mobile device management (MDM) is a type of security software used by an IT department to monitor, manage and secure employees' mobile devices that are deployed across multiple mobile service providers and across multiple mobile operating systems being used in the organization.
Mobile device management software is often combined with additional security services and tools such as Mobile Application Management to create a complete mobile device and security Enterprise Mobility Management solution.

MDN
Short for Mobile Directory Number it is the specific phone number assigned to a mobile phone.

MDRAM
Short for Multibank DRAM, a memory technology developed by MoSys Inc. MDRAM utilizes small banks of DRAM (32 KB each) in an array, where each bank has its own I/O port that feeds into a common internal bus. Because of this design, data can be read or written to multiple banks simultaneously, which makes it much faster than conventional DRAM.
Another advantage of MDRAM is that memory can be configured in smaller increments, which can reduce the cost of some components. For example, it's possible to produce MDRAM chips with 2.5 MB, which is what is required by video adapters for 24-bit color at a resolution of 1,024x768. With conventional memory architectures, it's necessary to jump all the way to 4 MB. Currently, MDRAM is used only in some video adapters and graphics accelerators.

mean_opinion_score
In voice telephony the term MOS, or mean opinion score is a measurement of the quality of human speech at the destination end of the circuit. MOS is expressed as a single number in the range of 1 (lowest perceived quality) to 5 (highest perceived quality). The MOS is an important factor in determining the QoS.

media
Plural of medium.
(1) Objects on which data can be stored. These include hard disks, floppy disks, CD-ROMs, and tapes.

media_server
In Internet and online communications, the media server processes all multimedia applications, such as call distribution, on-demand faxing, e-mail programs and others. In VoIP specific applications, the media server possesses and generates the media streams and handles all functions related to tasks such as decoding tones, bridging multiple streams, processing scripts, and recording audio.

Media_server_control
In Web site development with  ASP.NET, the Media server control enables you to easily integrate media sources such as audio or video, for example .wma, .mp3 or .wmv files, into the Web application, without requiring the developer to have any knowledge of XAML or JavaScript to implement the media. To use the Media control, you need to reference a media source file and select a built-in skin.  The Media control defines the player, and by default it uses JavaScript programming and the Silverlight player. See ASP.NET

meego
MeeGo is an open source, Linux project that merges the Moblin and Maemo software platforms into a single open source activity. MeeGo is headed by Intel, and Maemo, by Nokia: the MeeGo Technical Steering Group (TSG).  The day-to-day operations of the MeeGo programs are steered by a number of working groups, which are delegates of the Technical Steering Group.
MeeGo currently targets platforms such as netbooks/entry-level desktops, handheld computing and communications devices, in-vehicle infotainment devices, connected TVs, and media phones.

mega
In decimal systems, the prefix mega means one million, but in binary systems, mega stands for 2 to the 20th power, or 1,048,576. One megabyte, therefore, is either 1,000,000 or 1,048,576 bytes (this is equivalent to 1,024K), depending on the context.  

megabit
(1) When used to describe data storage, 1,024 kilobits.  (2) When used to described data transfer rates, it refers to one million bits. Networks are often measured in megabits per second, abbreviated as Mbps.  

Megabyte
(1) When used to describe data storage, 1,048,576 (2 to the 20th power) bytes. Megabyte is frequently abbreviated as M or MB.
(2) When used to describe data transfer rates, as in MBps, it refers to one million bytes.
 

Megaco
Megaco is a signaling protocol that enables switching of voice, fax and multimedia calls between the PSTN and IP networks. It is based on the term Media Gateway Controller (MGC) and is used between the Media Gateway and Media Gateway Controller in a VoIP network. Synonymous with H.248.

megapixel
One million pixels. The term is used in reference to the resolution of a graphics device, such as a scanner, digital camera or monitor.

MegaTransfer
Abbreviated as MT.A MegaTransfer is a unit of measurement that refers to the rate of signal on parallel I/O buses (like SCSI) where the data transfer rate depends upon the amount of data transferred in each data cycle, and is independent of the width of the bus. MegaTransfer is abbreviated at MT and is commonly seen written in the per second form; MT/s or MT/Sec.An Example: A 10 MT/sec rate on a 1-byte wide (narrow) bus results in a 10 Mbytes/sec transfer rate, but on a 2-byte (wide) bus, it is a 20 Mbytes/sec transfer rate.

member_server
As defined by Microsoft, in Active Directory server roles, computers that function as servers within a domain can have one of two roles: member server or domain controller. A member server is a computer that runs an operating system in the Windows 2000 Server family or the Windows Server 2003 family, belongs to a domain, and is not a domain controller. Member servers typically function as the following types of servers: file servers, application servers, database servers, Web servers, certificate servers, firewalls and remote-access servers.  See also Active Directory.

membrane_keyboard
A type of keyboard in which the keys are covered by a transparent, plastic shell. The keys have very little movement, but are sensitive to pressure applied on them. The advantage of membrane keyboards is that the covering protects the components from dirt, but it is difficult to type accurately and quickly.  

memory
Internal storage areas in the computer. The term memory identifies data storage that comes in the form of chips, and the word storage is used for memory that exists on tapes or disks. Moreover, the term memory is usually used as a shorthand for physical  memory, which refers to the actual chips capable of holding data. Some computers also use virtual memory, which expands physical memory onto a hard disk.
Every computer comes with a certain amount of physical memory, usually referred to as main memory or RAM. You can think of main memory as an array of boxes, each of which can hold a single byte of information. A computer that has 1 megabyte of memory, therefore, can hold about 1 million bytes (or characters) of information.
There are several different types of memory:

memory_address
A number that is assigned to each byte in a computer��s memory that the CPU uses to track where data and instructions are stored in RAM. Each byte is assigned a memory address whether or not it is being used to store data. The computer��s CPU uses the address bus to communicate which memory address it wants to access, and the memory controller reads the address and then puts the data stored in that memory address back onto the address bus for the CPU to use.

memory_bus
Another name for the system bus.

memory_card
An electronic flash memory storage disk commonly used in consumer electronic devices such as digital cameras,  MP3 players, mobile phones, and other small portable devices. Types of memory cards include PCMCIA, CompactFlash, SD Card, MiniSD,  xD-Picture Card and others. Memory cards are usually read by connecting the device containing the card to your computer, or by using a USB card reader. See also "Different Types of Memory Cards" in the "Did You Know...?" section of Webopedia.

memory_effect
The property of nickel-cadmium (NiCad) batteries that causes them to lose their capacity for full recharging if they are discharged repeatedly the same amount and then recharged without overcharge before they have fully drained. The term derives from the fact that the battery appears to have a memory for the amount of charging it can sustain.  The effect was first noticed in aerospace applications and has been widely misused with regard to the batteries used in portable computer devices. The memory effect is very rare in computer NiCad batteries, especially modern ones. 

memory_keys
On a memory module keys are physical notches on the module that prevent the memory from being incorrectly installed in a computer system. Memory keys also prevent the memory from being installed into a incompatible computer system.

memory_leak
A bug in a program that prevents it from freeing up memory that it no longer needs. As a result, the program grabs more and more memory until it finally crashes because there is no more memory left. 

memory_resident
Permanently in memory. Normally, a computer does not have enough memory to hold all the programs you use. When you want to run a program, therefore, the operating system is obliged to free some memory by copying data or programs from main memory to a disk. This process is known as swapping.  Certain programs, however, can be marked as being memory resident, which means that the operating system is not permitted to swap them out to a storage device; they will always remain in memory.  The programs and data used most frequently are the ones that should be memory resident. This includes central portions of the operating system and special programs, such as calendars and calculators, that you want to be able to access immediately.  Another term for memory resident is RAM resident. In DOS systems, memory-resident programs are called pop-up utilities  or TSRs (terminate and stay resident).   

memory_resident_virus
A virus that stays in memory after it executes and after its host program is terminated. In contrast, non-memory-resident viruses only are activated when an infected application runs.

memristance
Short for memory resistance, memristance is a property of an electronic component that lets it remember (or recall) the last resistance it had before being shut off. See also memristor.

memristor
Short for memory resistor, memristor is a passive two-terminal electronic device that is designed to express only the property of memristance. Memristors are being tested by HP Labs to create a more dense and energy-efficient memory chip. It is believed that chips embedded with memristors would function similar to flash drives and retain data, even after a computer has been powered off. See also memristance.

MEMS
Short for micro-electromechanical systems, the name for a micro fabrication technology used in making systems-on-a-chip (SoC) that embeds mechanical devices such as fluid sensors, mirrors, actuators, pressure and temperature sensors, vibration sensors and valves in semiconductor chips. MEMS combine many disciplines, including physics, bioinformatics, biochemistry, electrical engineering, optics and electronics.  Typical MEMS devices combine sensing, processing and/or actuating functions to alter the way that the physical world is perceived and controlled. They typically combine two or more electrical, mechanical, biological, magnetic, optical or chemical properties on a single microchip.  MEMS devices are already used in such fields as the automotive industry -- where they are incorporated into airbag and vehicle control; medicine -- where they are used to control medication dosing and control medical devices such as pacemakers; and construction -- where they are used in building materials that can sense changes in environmental stresses.   In a MEMS system, the integrated circuits (ICs) are considered the thinking part of the system while MEMS provides active perception and control functions. MEMS devices are divided into two different categories: microsensors that detect information and  actuators that respond to information.MEMS are sometimes referred to as microsystems, abbreviated MST.

menu
A list of commands or options from which you can choose. Most applications now have a menu-driven component. You can choose an item from the menu by highlighting it and then pressing the Enter or Return key, or by simply pointing to the item with a mouse and clicking one of the mouse buttons.
The antithesis of a menu-driven program is a command-driven system, in which you must explicitly enter the command you want rather than choose from a list of possible commands. Menu-driven systems are simpler and easier to learn but are generally not as flexible as command-driven systems, which lend themselves more naturally to interaction with programs.
There are several different types of menus:

menu_bar
)A horizontal menu that appears on top of a window. Usually, each option in a menu bar is associated with a pull-down menu.  

menu_driven
Refers to programs whose user interface employs menus. The antithesis of a menu-driven program is a command-driven program.  

menuetos
An open source operating system (OS) written entirely in 32/64-bit assembly language that supports 32/64 bit x86 assembly programming for less resource-hungry applications. Menuet64 is released under License and Menuet32 under GPL. MenuetOS is also called MeOS.

MEO
Short for medium, or middle, earth orbit, a satellite system used in telecommunications. MEO satellites orbit the earth between 1,000 and 22,300 miles above the earth's surface. MEOs are mainly used in geographical positioning systems and are not stationary in relation to the rotation of the earth.  Also see LEO and GEO.

Merced
The code name for a new 64-bit microprocessor being developed jointly by Intel and Hewlett-Packard. Although Merced will be able to run software written for the x86 architecture, it will utilize a new architecture, officially known as Intel Architecture-64 (IA-64). IA-64 will employ many cutting-edge microprocessor techniques, including long instruction words (LIW), instruction predication, branch elimination, and speculative loading.  Merced chips will be manufactured with a new 0.18-micron process technology and will contain tens of millions of transistors. It is designed primarily for use in servers and workstations. 

merchant_account
An industry term for a business banking relationship whereby you and a bank have arranged to accept credit card payments (usually, a local bank can suffice for this kind of relationship). Setting up a merchant account usually involves the bank understanding your business and working with a third-party processor to arrange a mechanism for accepting payments. Merchant accounts are usually required for accepting customer credit card and electronic payments through an electronic commerce Web site.

Merchant_Service_Provider
Abbreviated as MSP, a Merchant Service Provider is a company or organization who provides transaction processing solutions to merchants.

merchant_services
The term used to describe a category of financial services in the United States that is used by businesses. Merchant services are authorized financial services that allow a business to accept credit card or bank debit card transactions using online ordering or point of sales systems. To use merchant services, a US-business must obtain a merchant account to accept customer credit card and electronic payments through an electronic commerce Web site.
A commonly associated term is Merchant Service Provider (MSP) the name used to describe a company or organization that will provide transaction processing solutions to merchants. 

Mercury_LoadRunner
The name of an enterprise testing tool that predicts system behavior and performance. LoadRunner employs performance monitors, called agents, that trace events along an application path to quickly isolate system bottlenecks with minimal impact to the system. 

merge
)(1) To combine two files in such a way that the resulting file has the same organization as the two individual files. For example, if two files contain a list of names in alphabetical order, merging the two files results in one large file with all the names still in alphabetical order.  Note that merge is different from append. Append means to combine two files by adding one of them to the end of the other.  (2) In word processing, mail merge refers to generating form letters by combining one file containing a list of names, addresses, and other information with a second file containing the text of the letter.  

mesh
Also called mesh topology or a mesh network, mesh is a network topology in which devices are connected with many redundant interconnections between network nodes. In a true mesh topology every node has a connection to every other node in the network.

There are two types of mesh topologies: full mesh and partial mesh.

message_digest
The representation of text in the form of a single string of digits, created using a formula called a one-way hash function. Encrypting a message digest with a private key creates a digital signature, which is an electronic means of authentication.  

message_passing
A type of communication between processes. Message passing is a form of communication used in parallel programming and object-oriented programming. Communications are completed by the sending of messages (functions, signals and data packets) to recipients.  See also Message Passing Interface (MPI).

Message_Passing_Interface_MPI
The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a library specification for message-passing. It is a standard API (Application Programming Interface) that can be used to create parallel applications. The MPI standardization effort makes use of the most attractive features of a number of existing message passing systems, rather than selecting one of them and adopting it as the standard.

MTA
Short for message transfer agent, MTA is the program responsible for receiving incoming emails and delivering the messages to individual users. The MTA transfers messages between computers.
How MTA Works
Hidden from the average user, the message transfer agent is responsible for routing messages to their proper destinations. MTAs receive messages from both MUAs and other MTAs, although single-user machines more often retrieve mail messages using POP.
The MTA is commonly referred to as the mail server program. UNIX sendmail and Microsoft Exchange Sever are two examples of MTAs.

messy_URL
Slang term used to describe a URL that is not easy to read from a human perspective. For example, a messy URL might look something like this:
http://www.fakeURLwebopedia.com/article.php/3831706/
In contrast, a clean URL would contain more meaningful words, like this:

meta
In computer science, a common prefix that means "about". So, for example, metadata is data that describes other data (data about data). A metalanguage is a language used to describe other languages. A metafile is a file that contains other files. The HTML META tag is used to describe the contents of a Web page. 

meta_ad
Used in search engines, an advertisement displayed on the results page of a search, specific to the searched term. Also referred to as keyword advertising. Advertisers pay search engines to target their ads and only display the banners when relevant keywords are searched on by a user. Keyword advertising on the search engines enables an advertiser to target a specific audience. For example, if a user searched on the term "digital camera" the ads may be for electronic boutiques or camera shops that sell digital cameras. The meta ads are displayed on the dynamic pages that result whenever the keyword "digital camera" is searched on. 

meta_data
Data about data. Meta data describes how and when and by whom a particular set of data was collected, and how the data is formatted. Meta data is essential for understanding information stored in data warehouses.  

meta_refresh
Refers to HTML coding that redirects a Web site visitor to a new page after a set and specified number of seconds. Meta refresh tags are used by Web sites that have changed addresses but want visitors to be able to access the new URL by going through the old one. When a user is automatically brought to a new page, this is known as redirection.  Meta refresh tags are commonly used on the Internet. When a URL is entered that has changed or is no longer valid, the user will often see a message that states something like "This site has moved to a new location. You will automatically be brought to the new site in five seconds."

meta_tag
A special HTML tag that provides information about a Web page. Unlike normal HTML tags, meta tags do not affect how the page is displayed. Instead, they provide information such as who created the page, how often it is updated, what the page is about, and which keywords represent the page's content. Many search enginesuse this information when building their indices.
Also see How Web Search Engines Work in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia.

metadata
Data about data. Metadata describes how and when and by whom a particular set of data was collected, and how the data is formatted. Metadata is essential for understanding information stored in data warehouses and has become increasingly important in XML-based Web applications.


Metadata_Catalog_Service
Abbreviated as MCS, a Metadata Catalog Service is a mechanism for storing and accessing descriptive metadata and allows users to  query for data items based on desired attributes. MCS may be used for storing and accessing metadata about logical files.

metafile
A file that contains other files or information that describes another file.

metal-as-a-service_maas

Metal-as-a-Service, or MAAS, is a provisioning construct created by Canonical, developers of the Ubuntu Linux-based operating system. MAAS is designed to help facilitate and automate the deployment and dynamic provisioning of hyperscale computing environments such as big data workloads and cloud services.


metasearch
A search engine that queries other search engines and then combines the results that are received from all. In effect, the user is not using just one search engine but a combination of many search engines at once to optimize Web searching. For example, Dogpile is a metasearch engine. Also see How Web Search Engines Work in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia.

metasearch_engine
A search engine that queries other search engines and then combines the results that are received from all. In effect, the user is not using just one search engine but a combination of many search engines at once to optimize Web searching. For example, Dogpile is a metasearch engine. Also see How Web Search Engines Work in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia.

Metasploit
An open source attack framework first developed by H. D. Moore in 2003. Metasploit is used for hacking into systems for testing purposes. Metasploit provides useful information to people who perform penetration testing, IDS signature development, and exploit research. With the latest Metasploit 3.0 release, the project has moved to an all Ruby programming base.  See also "Metasploit 3.2 Offers More 'Evil Deeds'" on  Internetnews.com.

metaswitch_networks
Metaswitch Networks is the corporate name of a provider of carrier systems and software solutions. The company's products and services are used in the migration of communications networks to open, packet-based architectures. Metaswitch Networks provides scalable session control, media gateway and application/feature server solutions in addition to portable software components that are integrated into the products of the world's leading communications equipment manufacturers. Metaswitch Networks was founded in 1981 as Data Connection Limited by Ian S. Ferguson and 6 others, all formerly in various engineering, sales and management roles at IBM.

Metcalfes_Law
A theory argued by Robert Metcalfe, inventor of Ethernet, which states that the power of a network increases by the square of the number of nodes connected to it. For example, where X is the number of nodes, the power of the network is X squared.  Metcalfe observed that new technologies are valuable only when large numbers of people use them -- consider how less valuable the telephone would be if only two people in the world used them. The network becomes more valuable the more nodes that are connected to it.

method
In object-oriented programming, a procedure that is executed when an object receives a message. A method is really the same as a procedure, function , or routine in procedural programming languages. The only difference is that in object-oriented programming, a method is always associated with a class. 

metro
A new user interface from Microsoft that replaces the traditional Microsoft Windows operating system look and feel.  The Metro UI consists largely of a "Start Screen" made up of "Live Tiles," which are dynamic and continually updated links to applications and features.  The Metro design was introduced in the Microsoft Windows 7 Phone OS and is designed to be a predominately touch-based interface that will work across a large variety of devices, including mobile smartphones, tablet computers, laptops and desktop PCs.  Metro is also expected to be the default interface in the upcoming Windows 8 release.

Metro_Ethernet
Metro Ethernet is a general term used to describe an  Ethernet technology network in a metropolitan area. Metro Ethernet is used for connectivity to the public Internet, and is also used for connectivity between corporate sites that are separated geographically.
See also Carrier Ethernet.

Metro_Ethernet_Forum
The Metro Ethernet Forum is a non-profit organization chartered with the mission of accelerating worldwide adoption of Carrier Class Ethernet networks and services. The Forum is comprised of leading service providers, major incumbent local exchange carriers, top network equipment vendors, test equipment vendors and other prominent networking companies that share an interest in metro Ethernet.

MFC
Short for Microsoft Foundation Classes, a large library of C++ classes developed by Microsoft. For Windows -based applications written in C++, MFC provides an enormous headstart. One of the hardest parts of developing C++ programs is designing a logical hierarchy of classes. With MFC, this work has already been done.  MFC is bundled with several C++ compilers and is also available as part of the Microsoft Developer's Network (MSDN). 

MFD
Short for Made for Digg, MFD is a slang term used to describe content or blog posts designed only for garnering Digg.com traffic. The term was first used by Ethan Kaplan.See "Social Media Tips for Online Marketing Plus 30 Social Media Sites" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia.

MFLOP
Short for mega floating-point operations per second, MFLOPs are a common measure of the speed of computers used to perform floating-point calculations. Another common measure of computer speed and power is MIPS (million instructions per second), which indicates integer performance.  

MFM
Abbreviation of modified frequency modulation, an encoding scheme used by PC floppy disk drives and older hard drives. A competing scheme, known as RLL (run length limited), produces faster data access speeds and can increase a disk's storage capacity by up to 50 percent. RLL is used on most newer hard drives. 

MFP
Short for multifunction peripheral, a single device that serves several functions, including printing. Typically, multifunction printers can act as a printer, a scanner, a fax machine and a photocopier. These devices are becoming a popular option for SOHO users because they're less expensive than buying three or four separate devices. The downsides to combining all these functions in one device are:  If the device breaks, you may lose all of its functions at the same time. You can only do one operation at a time. For example, you can't print a document and receive a fax simultaneously.   MFPs are also known as multifunction printers. 

MFT
Short for Master File Table, a file that contains information in the form of 1024-byte records about every other file and directory in an NTFS volume (i.e., it is essentially a table of metadata). The data stored in the MFT is what the operating systemneeds to retrieve the files. For example, it contains file permissions, the name and size of the file, the date and time it was created and the date and time it was modified.
NTFS reserves the first 16 records in the MFT for special metadata files, listed below:

Record 0: metadata about the MFT itself.
Record 1: the MFT mirror record, which is a copy of the first 16 records of the MFT
Record 2: the NTFS volume��s logging file
Record 3: volume partitioninformation, such as its name, NTFS version and creation date and time
Record 4: metadata regarding the NTFS file attributes used on the volume
Record 5: a pointer to the volume��s root directory
Record 6: a map displaying which clusterson the volume are available for use
Record 7: a copy of the volume boot code
Record 8: a list of all the volume��s clusters that have been marked as unusable because of detected errors
Record 9: a table of disk quotas for NTFS 5.0 or later
Record 10: information for converting files to Unicode
Records 11-15: reserved for future metadata

The 17th record and those following it contain information for each file and directory on the NTFS volume in order to prevent excessive disk fragmentation as file on the NTFS are added, causing the MFT to grow.

MGCP
Short for Media Gateway Control Protocol, developed by Telcordia and Level 3 Communications, a control and signal standards to compete with the older H.323 standard for the conversion of audio signals carried on telephone circuits (PSTN ) to data packets carried over the Internet or other packet networks.   The reason new standards are being developed is because of the growing popularity of Voice over IP (VoIP ). Regular phones are relatively inexpensive because they don't need to be complex; they are fixed to a specific switch at a central switching location. IP phones and devices, on the other hand, are not fixed to a specific switch, so they must contain processors that enable them to function and be intelligent on their own, independent from a central switching location. This makes the terminal (phone or device) more complex, and therefore, more expensive. The MGCP is meant to simplify standards for this new technology by eliminating the need for complex, processor-intense IP telephony devices, thus simplifying and lowering the cost of these terminals.  

MHz
Abbreviation for megahertz. One MHz represents one million cycles per second. The speed of microprocessors, called the clock speed, is measured in megahertz. For example, a microprocessor that runs at 200 MHz executes 200 million cycles per second. Each computer  instruction requires a fixed number of cycles, so the clock speed determines how many instructions per second the microprocessor can execute. To a large degree, this controls how powerful the microprocessor is. Another chief factor in determining a microprocessor's power is its data width (that is, how many bits it can manipulate at one time).
In addition to microprocessors, the speeds of buses and interfaces are also measured in MHz.


MIB
Short for Management Information Base, a database of objects that can be monitored by a network management system. Both SNMP and RMONuse standardized MIB formats that allows any SNMP and RMON tools to monitor any device defined by a MIB.


mickey
A mickey is a unit of measurement for the speed and movement direction of a computer mouse. The speed of the mouse is the ratio between how many pixels the cursor moves on the screen and how many centimeters you move the mouse on the mouse pad. The directional movement is called the horizontal mickey count and the vertical mickey count. One mickey is approximately 1/200th of an inch.

MICR
Magnetic Ink Character Recognition is a character recognition system that uses special ink and characters. When a document that contains this ink needs to be read, it passes through a machine, which magnetizes the ink and then translates the magnetic information into characters.
MICR technology is used by banks. Numbers and characters found on the bottom of checks (usually containing the check number, sort number, and account number) are printed using Magnetic Ink. To print Magnetic Ink need, you need a laser printer that accepts MICR toner.
MICR provides a secure, high-speed method of scanning and processing information.

micro
(1) Short for microprocessor.  (2) Short for personal computer.  (3) A prefix meaning one millionth. For example, a microsecond is one millionth of a second.  (4) Something very small. For example, a microfloppy is a small floppy disk.  

Micro_Channel_Architecture_MCA
A bus architecture for older PCs. It is called a bus architecture  because it defines how peripheral devices and internal components communicate across the computer's  expansion bus. Introduced by IBM in 1987, MCA was designed to take the place of the older AT bus, the architecture used on IBM PC-ATs and compatibles. For a variety of reasons, however, the industry never accepted the new architecture.  

micro-server
A micro server (may also be written as microserver or MicroServer) is a small server appliance that works like a server. Micro servers are off-the-shelf appliances that are designed for ease of installation and maintenance. A micro server will come with the operating system, hardware and software preinstalled and configured by the manufacturer. Some configuration functions of the micro server may be performed by the end-user through a touch panel and access to the server appliance is through a Web browser.
A micro server is a popular choice for small- to medium-sized businesses that need a server but do not need a full-scale rack or tower server. Micro servers are also used by corporations that operate with minimal IT staff at local or branch offices.
A micro server may also be called a server appliance.

micro_electromechanical_systems
Short for micro-electromechanical systems, the name for a micro fabrication technology used in making systems-on-a-chip (SoC) that embeds mechanical devices such as fluid sensors, mirrors, actuators, pressure and temperature sensors, vibration sensors and valves in semiconductor chips. MEMS combine many disciplines, including physics, bioinformatics, biochemistry, electrical engineering, optics and electronics.  Typical MEMS devices combine sensing, processing and/or actuating functions to alter the way that the physical world is perceived and controlled. They typically combine two or more electrical, mechanical, biological, magnetic, optical or chemical properties on a single microchip.  MEMS devices are already used in such fields as the automotive industry -- where they are incorporated into airbag and vehicle control; medicine -- where they are used to control medication dosing and control medical devices such as pacemakers; and construction -- where they are used in building materials that can sense changes in environmental stresses.   In a MEMS system, the integrated circuits (ICs) are considered the thinking part of the system while MEMS provides active perception and control functions. MEMS devices are divided into two different categories: microsensors that detect information and  actuators that respond to information.MEMS are sometimes referred to as microsystems, abbreviated MST.

micro_FCBGA
Short for micro-Flip Chip Ball Grid Array, micro-FCBGA is one of two Mobile Pentium III Processor-M packages (the other is micro-FCPGA). The micro-FCBGA package is for surface-mount boards and consists of a die facedown on an organic substrate. An epoxy material surrounds the die, forming a smooth fillet. Where the micro-FCPGA uses pins, this package uses small balls as the contact for the  processor. The package uses 479 balls that are .78 mm in diameter and includes capacitors on the top.  Contrast with micro-FCPGA.

micro_FCPGA
Short for micro-Flip Chip Pin Grid Array, micro-FCPGA is one of two Mobile Pentium III Processor-M packages (the other is micro-FCBGA). The micro-FCPGA package is a die facedown on an organic substrate. An epoxy material surrounds the die, forming a smooth fillet. The package uses 478 pins that are 2.03 mm long and .32 mm in diameter and has capacitors on the bottom. Contrast with micro-FCPGA.

micro_justification
Refers to the use of microspacing to justify text.  

micro-virtualization
Micro-virtualization is a technology developed by desktop security firm Bromium to help ensure secure computing environments. Micro-virtualization utilizes a Xen-based security-focused hypervisor called a microvisor that creates hardware-isolated micro virtual machines (micro-VMs) for each computing task that utilizes data originating from an unknown source.
Tasks in this sense are the computation that takes place within an application as well as within the system kernel, and examples of user tasks the micro-virtualization can secure cover everything from accessing a web page to opening a document or spreadsheet to analyzing complex data.
Micro-virtualization isolates these computing tasks from other computing tasks, applications and network systems. Because each micro-VM is isolated from other micro-VMs as well as the operating system itself, a micro-VM that becomes infected by malware will be destroyed when the micro-VM shuts down, preventing the malware from being able to corrupt other tasks, apps or the system itself.

micro-vm
Micro-VMs, or micro virtual machines, are hardware-isolated virtual machines created by a microvisor to help ensure secure computing environments. Micro-VMs, or microVMs, are used in micro-virtualization to isolate individual computing tasks that work with data originating from unknown sources.
With micro-virtualization, the Xen-based microvisor that creates each microVM is able to isolate these computing tasks from other computing tasks, applications and network systems. Because each micro-VM is isolated from other micro-VMs as well as the operating system itself, a micro-VM that becomes infected by malware will be completely destroyed when the micro-VM shuts down, preventing the malware from being able to corrupt other tasks, apps or the system itself.
The hardware-isolated micro-VMs stand in contrast to software sandboxing, which can leave the operating system vulnerable to malware. Micro-VMs are restricted to accessing a minimal set of operating system resources and are unable to interact with other system processes, ensuring security while also limiting potential latency and bottleneck issues.

microarchitecture
Microarchitecture is the term used to describe the resources and methods used to achieve architecture specification. The term typically includes the way in which these resources are organized as well as the design techniques used in the processor to reach the target cost and performance goals. The microarchitecture essentially forms a specification for the logical implementation. [Source: Adapted from "The Anatomy of a High Performance Microprocessor A Systems Perspective"]

microbend
In fiber optic transmissions, microbend is an imperfection in the optical fiber which was created during manufacturing. Microbending can cause extrinsic attenuation, a reduction of optical power in the glass. Unlike macrobending, the imperfection may not always be visible.  Contrast with macrobend.

microblog
A type of blog that lets users publish short text updates. Bloggers can usually use a number of service for the updates including instant messaging, e-mail, or Twitter.

microbrowser
A microbrowser, also called a mobile browser or mini-browser. It is a type of browser designed to be used on the small screens of  many different types of mobile devices. It is commonly used on WAP-based phones, which require a gateway to translate Web pages, news feeds, and other Internet content.

microcode
(1) The lowest-level instructions that directly control a microprocessor. A single machine-language instruction typically translates into several microcode instructions.  In modern PC microprocessors, the microcode is hardwired and can't be modified. Some RISC designs go one step further by completely eliminating the microcode level so that machine instructions directly control the processor. At the other end of the spectrum, some mainframe and minicomputer architectures utilize programmable microcode. In this case, the microcode is stored in EEPROM, which can be modified. This is called microprogramming.  (2) Some people use microcode as a synonym of firmware.  

microcomputer
The term  microcomputer is generally synonymous with personal computer (PC), or a computer that depends on a microprocessor. Microcomputers are designed to be used by individuals, whether in the form of PCs, workstations or notebook computers. A microcomputer contains a central processing unit (CPU) on a microchip (the microprocessor), a memory system (typically read-only memory and random access memory), a bus system and I/O ports, typically housed in a motherboard.
Contrast with mainframe and minicomputer.

microcontroller
A highly integrated chip that contains all the components comprising a controller. Typically this includes a CPU, RAM, some form of ROM, I/O ports, and timers. Unlike a general-purpose computer, which also includes all of these components, a microcontroller is designed for a very specific task -- to control a particular system. As a result, the parts can be simplified and reduced, which cuts down on production costs.
Microcontrollers are sometimes called embedded microcontrollers, which just means that they are part of an embedded system-- that is, one part of a larger device or system.

microprocessor
A silicon chip that contains a CPU. In the world of personal computers, the terms microprocessor and CPU are used interchangeably. At the heart of all personal computers and most workstations sits a microprocessor. Microprocessors also control the logic of almost all digital devices, from clock radios to fuel-injection systemsfor automobiles.
Three basic characteristics differentiate microprocessors:

Instruction set: The set of instructions that the microprocessor can execute.
bandwidth : The number of bitsprocessed in a single instruction.
clock speed : Given in megahertz (MHz), the clock speed determines how many instructions per second the processor can execute.

In both cases, the higher the value, the more powerful the CPU. For example, a 32-bit microprocessor that runsat 50MHz is more powerful than a 16-bit microprocessor that runs at 25MHz.

microservice-architecture-microservices
Microservice architecture, also referred to as microservices, is a phrase used in software design to refer to a single software application designed as a suite of  independently deployable small services. For example, the small application might support multiple clients, expose APIs and integrate with other applications.
Microservices are basically designed to receive then process requests and respond accordingly, independent of other services. Over time the services can evolve to meet changing business needs.
Common Characteristics of Microservices
Currently there is no formal definition of microservice architecture, but software built as microservices do share common characteristics and functions, including multiple component services that can be deployed independently without compromising the application. Microservices are generally designed around business capabilities and priorities.

microsite
Also called a minisite, a microsite is a separate page of a Web site that has a separate URL than its home page and is used to provide information about and/or promote something that is related to the home page. For example, a museum's Web site may have a link to a microsite with information about a special exhibition the museum is running, or a computer manufacturer may create a microsite to give the user information about a new product design. Microsites often are temporary Web sites that are removed from Web servers once the promotion is over or the information is no longer relevant.

Short for micro-hypervisor, a microvisor works with the VT (Virtualization Technology) features built into Intel, AMD and other CPUs to create hardware-isolated micro virtual machines (micro-VMs) for each task performed by a user that utilizes data originating from an unknown source.
The micro-VMs created by the microvisor provide a secure environment, isolating user tasks from other tasks, applications and other systems on the network. Tasks in this case entail the computation that takes place within an application as well as within the system kernel, so the microvisor ensures security at both the application and operating system kernel levels.

middleware
(mid´&l-wār) (n.) Software that connects two otherwise separate applications. For example, there are a number of middleware products that link a database system to a Web server. This allows users to request data from the database using forms displayed on a Web browser, and it enables the Web server to return dynamic Web pages based on the user's requests and profile.
The term middleware is used to describe separate products that serve as the glue between two applications. It is, therefore, distinct from import and export features that may be built into one of the applications. Middleware is sometimes called plumbingbecause it connects two sides of an application and passes data between them. Common middleware categories include:

ESBs
TP monitors
DCE environments
RPC systems
Object Request Brokers (ORBs)
Database access systems
Message Passing


MIDI
Pronounced middy, an acronym for musical instrument digital interface, a standard adopted by the electronic music industry for controlling devices, such as synthesizers and sound cards, that emit music. At minimum, a MIDI representation of a sound includes values for the note's pitch, length, and volume. It can also include additional characteristics, such as attack and delay time.
The MIDI standard is supported by most synthesizers, so sounds created on one synthesizer can be played and manipulated on another synthesizer. Computers that have a MIDI interface can record sounds created by a synthesizer and then manipulate the data to produce new sounds. For example, you can change the key of a composition with a single keystroke.
A number of software programs are available for composing and editing music that conforms to the MIDI standard. They offer a variety of functions: for instance, when you play a tune on a keyboard connected to a computer, a music program can translate what you play into a written score.

MIDL
Short for Microsoft Interface Definition Language, MIDL defines interfaces between client and server programs. Microsoft includes the MIDL compiler with the Platform SDK to enable developers to create the interface definition language (IDL) files and application configuration files (ACF) required for remote procedure call interfaces and COM/DCOM interfaces. MIDL also supports the generation of type libraries for OLE Automation. Create client and server programs for heterogeneous network environments that include such operating systems as Unix and Apple.  [Source: MSDN Library - MIDL]
See also IDL.

MIDlet
An application that conforms to the MIDP standard.

MIDP
Short for Mobile Information Device Profile. MIDP is a set of J2ME APIs that define how software applications interface with cellular phones and two-way pagers.  Applications conforming to this standard are called MIDlets.  Companies that have worked on the MIDP include Ericsson, NEC, Nokia, NTT DoCoMo, Palm Computing, Research In Motion (RIM), DoCoMo, LG TeleCom, Samsung and Motorola.

MIF
Short for Management Information Format, a format used to describe a hardware or software component. MIF files are used by DMI to report system configuration information. Although MIF is a system-independent format, it is used primarily by Windows systems. To install a new device in a Windows 95 system, you need the corresponding MIF file. 

Mighty_Mouse
The name given to Apple's first multi-button mouse, launched in 2005. This was the first mouse manufactured and sold by Apple Computers since the  Lisa era in 1983 that contained more than a single button. The Mighty Mouse offers four separate button areas including a touch-sensitive top for both the left and right click, a 360-degree clickable scroll bar, and side squeeze buttons to instantly access the Mac OS X Dashboard or other customizable features. Currently the Mighty Mouse is available in both wired and wireless versions.

Millennium
A Microsoft research project that seeks to build distributed computing -- networks that share resources. While Millennium includes many of the same goals as Sun Microsystems' Jini, which seeks to completely separate the operating system from applications, Millenium plans to remove only some applications from the desktop operating system. Microsoft promotes Millennium as a technology capable of immediately assimilating new machines, links, and resources added to a network, and capable of adjusting behavior to improve performance.  

millisecond
One thousandth of a second. Access times of hard disk drives are measured in milliseconds, usually abbreviated as ms.  

MIMD
Short for multiple instruction, multiple data. A type of parallel computing architecture that is classified under Flynn's taxonomy. Multiple computer instructions, which may or may not be the same, and which may or may not be synchronized with each other, perform actions simultaneously on two or more pieces of data. The class of distributed memory MIMD machines is the fastest growing segment of the family of high-performance computers (Charles Belov, 1997).
See also Flynn's taxonomy.

MIME
Short for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, a specification for formatting non-ASCII messages so that they can be sent over the Internet. Many e-mail clients now support MIME, which enables them to send and receive graphics, audio, and video files via the Internet mail system. In addition, MIME supports messages in character sets other than ASCII.
There are many predefined MIME types, such as GIF graphics files and PostScript files. It is also possible to define your own MIME types.
In addition to e-mail applications, Web browsers also support various MIME types. This enables the browser to display or output files that are not in HTML format.

MIMO
Acronym for multiple-in, multiple-out. MIMO (multiple-in, multiple-out) takes advantage of multiplexing to increase wireless bandwidth and range. MIMO  algorithms send information out over two or more antennas and the information is received via multiple antennas as well.  On normal radio, multiplexing would cause interference, but MIMO uses the additional pathways to transmit more information and then recombines the signal on the receiving end. MIMO systems provide a significant capacity gain over conventional single antenna systems, along with more reliable communication. The benefits of MIMO lead many to believe it is the most promising of emerging wireless technologies.

MIN
Short for Mobile Identification Number it is a unique 24-bit number assigned by the wireless service provider (carrier) to each mobile phone it sells or includes in service plans.

Mini_DV
A type of camcorder recording media format that handles recording, manipulating, storing and playing back video images digitally. A Mini DV Cassette (DVC) can hold 11GB of data on a tape 65 meters long. It's used for digital video recording, not analog and the word "mini" refers to the smaller tape size used by the device.

Mini_ITX
A motherboard form factor that is smaller than the standard ATX size of 300mm x 240mm. The Mini-ITX is 170mm x 170mm (slightly smaller than the micro-ATX) and reduces the size of standard desktops and computer towers. Mini-ITX was developed by VIA Technologies.
See  What You Need to Know About Motherboards in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.  See also  From AT to BTX: Motherboard Form Factors.

msata
Mini-SATA, or mSATA, is a low-profile interface connector that enables more effective Serial ATA (SATA) integration in small form-factor drives roughly the size of a business card, such as solid state disks (SSDs).  mSATA supports data transfer rates of 1.5 Gb/s and 3.0 Gb/s for high performance while enabling compact integration in a wide variety of applications for the hard drives and solid state drives (SSDs) used in ultraportable laptops, netbooks and similar mobile devices.
The Serial ATA International Organization (SATA-IO), the same organization responsible for the SATA, SATA II, and SATA III (SATA 6 Gb/s) specifications, released the mSATA specification in September 2009, and mSATA drives are now available from a variety of manufacturers, including Toshiba, Samsung, HP, Intel, SanDisk and Dell.

minicomputer
A midsized computer. In size and power, minicomputers lie between workstations and mainframes. In the past decade, the distinction between large minicomputers and small mainframes has blurred, however, as has the distinction between small minicomputers and workstations. But in general, a minicomputer is a multiprocessing system capable of supporting from 4 to about 200 users simultaneously.


MiniDVD
A 3-inch DVD media that was developed for camcorders. A single sided MiniDVD has the capacity to hold 1.4GB of data, which is approximately 30 minutes of recording time in standard DVD quality recording (or 120 minutes of video). The double-sided MiniDVD media hold 2.92GB of data.

MinSP
Short for stack page, a reserved space in Windows of 4K of memory that a 32-bit device driver uses to hold data and instructions as it works. The default setting in Windows sets one stack page for device drivers and two spare pages for temporary allocations. The spare pages are called MinSPs, short for minimum stack pages.

mgse
Mint GNOME Shell Extensions (MGSE) is a desktop layer for the Linux Mint Linux-based operating system that "sits on top" of the GNOME 3 desktop environment and delivers an interface that is more familiar to users of GNOME 2 as well as to users of previous Linux Mint distribution releases. MGSE users have the option of disabling all components within MGSE for a pure GNOME 3 experience, or they can enable all the components for a desktop that retains the look and feel of GNOME 2.
Also known as Linux Mint Shell Extensions for GNOME 3, the MGSE layer was developed by Clement Lefebvre, who also created and continues to develop the Linux Mint distribution. The Mint GNOME Shell Extensions are a default option of the Linux Mint 12 release, but the core developers have largely shifted focus to their own desktop environment known as Cinnamon, which is a fork of GNOME 3.

minutiae
In biometrics and fingerprint scanning, minutiae refers to specific plot points on a fingerprint. This includes characteristics such as ridge bifurcation or a ridge ending on a fingerprint.
 
See  "How Fingerprint Scanners Work" in the ""Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. See also  "How Biometrics Security Works" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia.

MIPS
Acronym for million instructions per second. A old measure of a computer's speed and power, MIPS measures roughly the number of machine instructions that a computer can execute in one second. However, different instructions require more or less time than others, and there is no standard method for measuring MIPS. In addition, MIPS refers only to the CPU speed, whereas real applications are generally limited by other factors, such as I/O speed. A machine with a high MIPS rating, therefore, might not run a particular application any faster than a machine with a low MIPS rating. For all these reasons, MIPS ratings are not used often anymore. In fact, some people jokingly claim that MIPS really stands for Meaningless Indicator of Performance.
Despite these problems, a MIPS rating can give you a general idea of a computer's speed. The IBM PC/XT computer, for example, is rated at ¼ MIPS, while Pentium-based PCsrun at over 100 MIPS.


miracast
Miracast is a peer-to-peer wireless technology that enables users to mirror, or share, their computer or mobile device screen to other computers, TVs, projectors, streaming players or other electronic devices. In order for Miracast to work, both devices need to support the technology, although wireless Miracast adapters can be purchased for devices that lack built-in support for the technology.
Unlike some streaming technologies, Miracast bypasses the use of a home network (wired or Wi-Fi) and instead creates a direct, peer-to-peer connection between the Miracast-capable devices. Once enabled, video (up to 1080p HD video), audio (up to 5.1 surround sound), photos and more can be shared between devices.
Miracast's Rise in Popularity and Other Stream Options
Miracast started picking up steam in 2013, with Google announcing that its Android mobile operating system would support the technology (as of Android 4.2 "Jelly Bean") and later Microsoft adding Miracast support in Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1. Intel also added support for Miracast in version 3.5 of its WiDi technology.

mIRC
mIRC is one of the most popular IRC clients for Windows. mIRC is a user-friendly IRC client that offers users many options and tools.  It was written by Khaled Mardam-Bey. mIRC is shareware, which means that you can download mIRC and try it out freely for 30 days to evaluate it. mIRC celebrated its tenth year of development in February 2005.

mirror_site
A Web site that is a replica of an already existing site, used to reduce network traffic (hits on a server) or improve the availability of the original site. Mirror sites are useful when the original site generates too much traffic for a single server to support.
Mirror sites also increase the speed with which files or Web sites can be accessed: users can download files more quickly from a server that is geographically closer to them. For example, if a busy New York-based Web site sets up a mirror site in England, users in Europe can access the mirror site faster than the original site in New York.
Sites such as Netscape that offer copies or updates of popular software often set up mirror sites to handle the large demand that a single site may not be able to handle.

MIS
MIS is short for management information system or management information services. 
Management information system, or MIS, broadly refers to a computer-based system that provides managers with the tools to organize, evaluate and efficiently manage departments within an organization. In order to provide past, present and prediction information, a management information system can include software that helps in decision making, data resources such as databases, the hardware resources of a system, decision support systems, people management and project management applications, and any computerized processes that enable the department to run efficiently.
Management Information System Managers
The role of the management information system (MIS) manager is to focus on the organization's information and technology systems. The MIS manager typically analyzes business problems and then designs and maintains computer applications to solve the organization's problems.

MISD
Short for multiple instruction, single data. A type of parallel computing architecture that is classified under Flynn's taxonomy. Each processor owns its control unit and its local memory, making them more powerful than those used in SIMD computers. Each processor operates under the control of an instruction stream issued by its control unit: therefore the processors are potentially all executing different programs on different data while solving different sub-problems of a single problem. This means that the processors usually operate asynchronously.  [Source: Tommesani] See also Flynn's taxonomy.

mistweet
Slang term used to describe a tweet (a Twitter message) that you later regret having sent.See "Cool Twitter Tools for Better Tweeting" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia.

Open Source Initiative OSI. Ruby on Rails is one of many well-known software packages that is distributed under the MIT license.
 
See "What is Open Source Software?" for more information.

MLC
Short for multi-level cell MLC is a type of NAND flash memory that is commonly found in standard USB cards. MLC works by storing three or more bits in each cell that requires higher power consumption and slower transfer speeds but it results in cheaper cards, when compared to single-level cell (SLC) cards. See also "Different Types of Memory Cards" in the "Did You Know...?" section of Webopedia.  

mlook
Short for mouse-look, the term mlook is derived from the command line used in some FPS games which allow the gamer to look around a 3-D game environment as a person would. The movement is done by moving the mouse around - and the results in the game are the equivalent of the game character moving his/her head around to see in 3-D.

MLP


MLP_Lossless
MLP Lossless is a licensed trademark of Dolby Laboratories. It's the core technology of Advanced Resolution multichannel and stereo DVD-Audio. MLP Lossless enables producers to encode up to six channels of 96 kHz/24 bit audio, or two channels of 192 kHz/24 bit audio onto a DVD-Audio disc, resulting in playback that's bit-for-bit identical to the studio master. MLP Lossless has been accepted as the standard in the high-definition DVD-Video (HD DVD) format.

MLPPP
Short for MultiLink PPP, an extension of the PPP that allows the B-channels of ISDN lines to be used in combination as a single transmission line, doubling throughput to 128 Kbps.  MLPPP is also referred to as MPPP, MLP and channel bundling.

Also see  All About Multiplayer PC Gaming in Webopedia's "Did You Know...?" section.

MMS
Short for Multimedia Message Service.

MMU
Short for memory management unit, the hardware component that manages virtual memory systems. Typically, the MMU is part of the CPU, though in some designs it is a separate chip. The MMU includes a small amount of memory that holds a table matching virtual addresses to physical addresses. This table is called the Translation Look-aside Buffer (TLB). All requests for data are sent to the MMU, which determines whether the data is in RAM or needs to be fetched from the mass storage device. If the data is not in memory, the MMU issues a page fault interrupt.  

MMX
Short for Multimedia Extensions, a set of 57 multimedia instructions built into Intel  microprocessors and other x86-compatible microprocessors. MMX-enabled microprocessors can handle many common multimedia operations, such as digital signal processing (DSP), that are normally handled by a separate sound or video card. However, only software especially written to call MMX instructions -- so-called MMX-enabled software -- can take advantage of the MMX instruction set. 

MNP
Abbreviation of Microcom Networking Protocol, a communications protocol developed by Microcom, Inc., that is used by many high-speed modems. MNP supports several different classes of communication, each higher class providing additional features. Modems can support one or more classes. Class 4 provides error detection and automatically varies the transmission speed based on the quality of the line. Class 5 provides data compression. Class 6 attempts to detect the highest transmission speed of the modem at the other end of the connect and transmit at that speed.  The most common levels of MNP support are Class 4 and Class 5, frequently called MNP-4 and MNP-5. Using the data compression techniques provided by MNP-5, devices can double normal transmission speeds.  Because MNP is usually built into the modem hardware, it affects all data transmission. In contrast, software protocols, such as Xmodem and Kermit, affect only file transfer operations.  

MO
(adj.) Short for magneto-optical, a type of data storage technology that combines magnetic disk technologies with optical technologies, such as those used in CD-ROMs. Like magnetic disks, MO disks can be read and written to. And like floppy disks, they are removable. However, their storage capacity can be more than 200 megabytes, much greater than magnetic floppies. In terms of data access speed, they are faster than floppies but not as fast as hard disk drives. 

mobile_application
Also called mobile apps, it is a term used to describe Internet applications that run on smartphones and other mobile devices. Mobile applications usually help users by connecting them to Internet services more commonly accessed on desktop or notebook computers, or help them by making it easier to use the Internet on their portable devices. A mobile app may be a mobile Web site bookmarking utility, a mobile-based instant messaging client, Gmail for mobile, and many other applications.

mobile_botnet
A type of botnet that targets mobile devices such as smartphones, attempting to gain complete access to the device and its contents as well as providing control to the botnet creator.  Mobile botnets take advantage of unpatched exploits to provide hackers with root permissions over the compromised mobile device, enabling hackers to send e-mail or text messages, make phone calls, access contacts and photos, and more.  Most mobile botnets go undetected and are able to spread by sending copies of themselves from compromised devices to other devices via text messages or e-mail messages.
Examples of mobile botnets include the iPhone SMS attack that affected iPhone and iPad devices, the DreamDroid malware that compromised Google Android devices, the ZeuS variant (Zitmo) that targeted Blackberry users, and CommWarrior and Sexy Space, both of which affected Symbian Series mobile devices.

mobile_broadband
The phrase used  to describe Internet access (wireless communications) that is obtained through  a portable modem or other device, such as a mobile phone. Different types of  wireless network standards support a wide range of  bandwidths but most are  suitable for sending and receiving small bursts of data, such as e-mail and Web  browsing, as well as large volumes of data.
Mobile broadband is a phrase that is typically used by a wireless carriers to  describe its mobile Internet access service that uses  the mobile phone infrastructure, or cellular network. A number of network  standards can be used for mobile broadband including:

CDMA 
GPRS  
3G  
WiMAX 
UMTS 
 HSPDA 
HSUPA 

See also 802.11 for a  complete overview of the IEEE 802.11 specifications for wireless LAN (WLAN)  technology, an over-the-air interface between a wireless client and a base  station or between two wireless clients.

mobile_cloud_storage
A form of cloud storage that applies to storing an individual's mobile device data in the cloud and providing the individual with access to the data from anywhere. Mobile cloud storage additionally facilitates syncing and sharing data across multiple devices such as mobile phones and tablet computers.  Mobile cloud storage is also sometimes referred to as cloud storage on the go, personal cloud storage or pocket cloud storage.
Apple's iCloud, Google Drive and Dropbox are some of the most recognizable examples of mobile cloud storage.

mobile-device-security
Security measures designed to protect the sensitive information stored on and transmitted by smartphones, tablets, laptops and other mobile devices. Mobile device security spans the gamut from user authentication measures and mobile security best practices for protecting against compromised data in the event of unauthorized access or accidental loss of the mobile device to combat malware, spyware and other mobile security threats that can expose a mobile device’s data to hackers.
Most mobile devices feature mobile operating systems with built-in mobile device security features, including iOS for iPhones and iPads, Google's Android platform and Microsoft's Windows Phone. Additionally, a variety of third-party mobile device security solutions are available for providing an additional layer of protection for mobile devices.

mobile_instant_messaging
A mobile phone messaging service that enables the user to use special versions of instant messaging clients through their mobile device, rather than desktop PC.  See also instant messaging.

Mobile_IP
A standard that allows users with mobile devices whose IP addresses are associated with one network to stay connected when moving to a network with a different IP address.  When a user leaves the network with which his device is associated (home network) and enters the domain of a foreign network, the foreign network uses the Mobile IP protocol to inform the home network of a care-of address to which all packets for the user's device should be sent.  Mobile IP is most often found in wireless WAN environments where users need to carry their mobile devices across multiple LANs with different IP addresses.  A common analogy to explain Mobile IP is when someone moves his residence from one location to another. Person moves from Boston to New York. Person drops off new mailing address to New York post office. New York post office notifies Boston post office of new mailing address. When Boston post office receives mail for person it knows to forward mail to person's New York address.

Mobile_Location_Protocol


mobile_malware

mobile_phone
An electronic telecommunications device, often referred to as a cellular phone or cellphone. Mobile phones connect to a wireless communications network through radio wave or satellite transmissions. Most mobile phones provide voice communications, Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Message Service (MMS),  and newer phones may also provide Internet services such as Web browsing and e-mail.
See also cellular.

mobile_phone_forensics
Mobile phone forensics is the science of retrieving data from a mobile phone under forensically sound conditions. This includes full data retrieval and examination of data found on the SIM/USIM, the phone body itself and the optional memory cards. Data retrieved and examined can include images, videos, text or SMS messages, call times and contact numbers.

mobile_security
Mobile security involves protecting both personal and business information stored on and transmitted from smartphones, tablets, laptops and other mobile devices. The term mobile security is a broad one that covers everything from protecting mobile devices from malware threats to reducing risks and securing mobile devices and their data in the case of theft, unauthorized access or accidental loss of the mobile device.
User Authentication Methods for Mobile Security
Mobile security also refers to the means by which a mobile device can authenticate users and protect or restrict access to data stored on the device through the use of passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), pattern screen locks or more advanced forms of authentication such as fingerprint readers, eye scanners and other forms of biometric readers.
Mobile security solutions and apps are available from a wide array of vendors for all of the popular mobile operating systems, including iOS for iPhones and iPads, Google’s Android platform and Microsoft’s Windows Phone.  Mobile security is closely related to mobile device management (MDM), which is a term that specifically applies to protecting mobile devices in the enterprise or business environments from loss or theft, as well as protecting the data on these devices.

mobile_security_apps
Mobile security apps are applications designed for smartphone and tablet mobile devices to protect and secure the device and its data from unauthorized access in the case of theft or accidental loss. Some mobile security apps can also help users locate their device if it’s lost or stolen.  Additional security features typically offered by mobile security apps include malware detection and removal, VPN connectivity for protecting data in transit, scanning websites for potential phishing schemes or other fraudulent activity and more.
Whereas most of the mobile security apps in Apple’s iOS are built into the mobile operating system, numerous third-party mobile security apps are available for Google’s Android mobile OS platform, Microsoft’s Windows Phone and, to a lesser extent, iOS. Well-known security companies like Norton, McAfee, Lookout, BitDefender and ESET offer mobile security apps for Android, Microsoft Windows Phone and/or iOS.

mobile_security_best_practices
Mobile security best practices are recommended guidelines and safeguards for protecting mobile devices and the sensitive data contained on them. Mobile security best practices apply to mobile devices used in business environments as well as for personal use, and the guidelines are largely the same in either scenario.
10 Mobile Security Best Practices
Some of the most common mobile security best practices include:



1. User Authentication
Restricting access to the device by requiring user authentication. Most mobile devices can be locked with a screen lock, password or personal identification number (PIN), but these measures are typically turned off by default.
By requiring authentication before a mobile device can be accessed, the data on the device is protected in case of accidental loss or theft of the mobile device. Ensure the use of a powerful password in order to make it more difficult for a potential thief to access the device.



mobile-security-management

Mobile security management is a term that's often used interchangeably with the more common Mobile Device Management (MDM). Both terms refer to mobile security best practices and mobile security solutions that monitor, manage and secure the mobile devices used in an enterprise.    Some mobile security firms, like Marble Security, distinguish mobile security management (MSM) from MDM in that MSM entails dynamically monitoring for emerging mobile security threats, learning and adapting to these threats in real time in order to provide clients with a more thorough end-to-end mobile security strategy than the static security measures typically provided by MDM solutions.

mobile_security_threats
Mobile security threats include both physical and software-based threats that can compromise the data on smartphones, tablets and similar mobile devices. Mobile security threats include everything from mobile forms of malware and spyware to the potential for unauthorized access to a device’s data, particularly in the case of accidental loss or theft of the device.
Mobile malware and spyware security threats can access a device’s private data without a user’s knowledge or consent and can also perform malicious actions without the user knowing, including transferring control of the device to a hacker, sending unsolicited messages to the device’s contacts, making expensive phone calls on smartphones, and more.
Physical Mobile Security Threats and Other Types of Threats
When it comes to physical mobile security threats, phones that lack passwords, screen locks or other forms of authentication are vulnerable to unauthorized access, which can compromise sensitive information stored on the mobile device. And if the device gets lost or stolen, hackers can bypass many forms of authentication in order to gain access to the device’s sensitive information.

Mobile_Station_Application_Execution_Environment
Mobile Station Application Execution Environment (MexE)  is a framework to ensure a predictable environment for third-party applications in GSM or UMTS handsets. MExE does this by defining different technology requirements called classmarks. MExE classmark 1 is based on WAP, classmark 2 on PersonalJava and JavaPhone, and classmark 3 on J2ME CLDC and MIDP. Other classmarks may be defined in the future. MExE specifies additional requirements for all classmarks, for instance a security environment, capability and content negotiation, a user profile, user interface personalization, management of services and virtual home environment. A handset can support multiple classmarks. (Source: DeVx)

Mobile_Switching_Center
Abbreviated as MSC the mobile switching center connects calls by switching the digital voice data packets from one network path to another (also called routing). The MSC also provides the information that is  needed to support mobile service subscribers, such as user registration and authentication information.

mobile_voip
Mobile VoIP refers to mobile handsets that have been integrated into an existing VoIP, or Internet telephony, network, typically via a Wi-Fi or 3G/4G cellular network that the mobile device is connected to.
In most cases, mobile phone users will need to download a service provider's software application to their smartphone before being able to make mobile VoIP calls from that phone.  Once properly configured, mobile VoIP calls can be made anywhere the user has access to a Wi-Fi or 3G/4G network.
See   The Difference Between VoIP and PSTN Systems in the   Did You Know... section of Webopedia.Also see the   VoIP Meets Wi-Fi article in the   Did You Know? section of Webopedia. 

moblog
Acronym used to combine the terms "mobile" and "Web log". Where a Web log (also called a blog) is a Web page that serves as a publicly accessible personal journal for an individual, a moblog is a blog which has been posted to the Internet from a mobile device such as a mobile phone or PDA.

MoCA
Short for Multimedia over Coax Alliance, MoCA is a standards organization that supports a technology to provide the backbone for home digital entertainment networks.

The term mod is derived from the act of modifying a game. To mod a game is to create custom levels, objects, characters, or even unique or stand-alone game from an existing game engine. Many games come with an editor that allow for easier modding. A person who mods a game is called a modder.

modal_window
A modal window is any type of window that is a child (secondary window) to a parent window and usurps the parent's control. It is commonly associated with an Internet Web site pop-up  window that stays in front of the original window.  A user may not press any controls or enter any information on the parent window (the original window which opened the modal) until the modal has been closed. A modal window is commonly used when the author wants to retain the user's focus on the information in the modal as it is impossible for the user to interact with the other windows of the same process.

Modbus_protocol
An an application layer messaging protocol at Level 7 of the OSI Model that provides client/server communication between devices connected on different types of buses or networks. The Modbus messaging structure was developed by Modicon in 1979. Different versions of Mopdbus used today include Modbus RTU (based on serial communication like RS485 and RS232), Modbus ASCII and Modbus TCP, which is the Modbus RTU protocol embedded into TCIP packets. It's an open protocol, meaning the specification is available free of charge for download, and there are no licensing fees required for using Modbus or  Modbus TCP/IP protocols.

mode
(n.) The state or setting of a program or device. For example, when a word processor is in insert mode, characters that you type are inserted at the cursor position. In overstrike  mode, characters typed replace existing characters.  The term mode implies a choice -- that you can change the setting and put the system in a different mode.   

Model_View_Controller
Abbreviated as MVC, Model-View-Controller is the term used to describe a software paradigm that separates objects into one of three categories:   models for maintaining data views for displaying all or a portion of the data controllers for handling events that affect the model or views.  In this separation, the view and controller depend on the model. However, the model does not depend on either of the two making it so the model can be built and tested independent of the visual presentation.  The Struts Framework is one of many examples of Web application development standards that is based on the Model-View-Controller design paradigm.

modeless_window
Similar to a modal window, a modeless window is a feature that was first introduced in Internet Explorer 5. It launches a secondary (child) window that stays active on the user's screen until dismissed. Modeless windows can be minimized or hidden behind other windows. Unlike a modal window, a modeless window will  allow the user to continue working with the application while the modeless window is open.

modeling
Generally, the process of representing a real-world object or phenomenon as a set of mathematical equations. More specifically, the term is often used to describe the process of representing 3-dimensional objects in a computer. All 3-D applications, including CAD/CAM and animation software, perform modeling.  

modem

(mō´dem) (n.) Short for modulator-demodulator. A modem is a device or program that enables a computer to transmit data over, for example, telephone or cable lines. Computer information is stored digitally, whereas information transmitted over telephone lines is transmitted in the form of analog waves. A modem converts between these two forms.
Standard Modem Interface
Fortunately, there is one standard interface for connecting external modems to computers called RS-232. Consequently, any external modem can be attached to any computer that has an RS-232 port, which almost all personal computers have. There are also modems that come as an expansion board that you can insert into a vacant expansion slot. These are sometimes called onboard or internal modems.

moderated_newsgroup
A newsgroup monitored by an individual or group (the moderator) who has the authority to block messages deemed inappropriate. Moderated newsgroups have fewer flames and less spam than unmoderated forums. 

moderation
In online discussion forums and  blogs with comments enabled, the site or forum authors monitor and often censor inappropriate comments and posts that are left for public display. The moderation authority is called a moderator. See "All About Online Forums" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia.

moderator
In online forums and other online discussion spaces the moderator has the authority to block messages deemed inappropriate or break the rules of that discussion space. Moderators generally try to keep users on topic and keep the discussion thread or chat room free of personal insults and derogatory comments.

modifier_key
A key on a keyboard that only has a meaning when combined with another key. Examples of modifier keys include the Shift, Control, and Alt keys.  

Modula_2
A programming language designed by Niklaus Wirth, the author of Pascal. Wirth created Modula-2 in the late 1970s to answer many of the criticisms leveled at Pascal, which he had created ten years earlier. In particular, Modula-2 addresses Pascal's lack of support for separate compilation of modules and multitasking. Although Modula-2 found support in academia, it is not often used for applications.  

modular_architecture
Refers to the design of any system composed of separate components that can be connected together. The beauty of modular architecture is that you can replace or add any one component (module) without affecting the rest of the system. The opposite of a modular architecture is an integrated architecture, in which no clear divisions exist between components.  The term modular can apply to both hardware and software. Modular software   design, for example, refers to a design strategy in which a system is composed of relatively small and autonomous routines that fit together.  

modular_computer
Where the word modular represents in sections or designed for easy change and expansion, the term modular computer refers to a multiprocessing computer system where processing, memory, and  peripheral units can be added or removed without disrupting its operation.

modulate
To blend data into a carrier signal. At the receiving side, a device demodulates the signals by separating the constant carrier signals from the variable data signals. For example, radio uses two types of modulation - amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) - to mix audio signals with an AM or FM carrier signal. A modem modulates data by converting it to audible tones that can be transmitted on a telephone wire, and demodulates received signals to get the data.   

modulation_fallback
When signals are transmitted from one modem to another, each modem interfaces at a specific speed. If one modem communicates at a faster rate than the modem at the other end, then the faster modem falls back to a slower modulation. For example, if a user connects to the Internet using a 14000-bps modem and attempts to download a file from a user who is connected to the Internet at 2400-bps, modulation fallback occurs and the two modems will only be able to communicate at the slower speed because that is the highest speed they have in common.

module
(1) In software, a module is a part of a program. Programs are composed of one or more independently developed modules that are not combined until the program is linked. A single module can contain one or several routines.
(2) In hardware, a module is a self-contained component.


MOEMS
Short for Micro-Opto-Electro-Mechanical Systems, also known as optical MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical  Systems) and generally taken to include waveguides, diffraction gratings, moving mirror and moving bubble devices. The primary goal is to endow systems with the capability to alter or modulate the path of a light beam, and, in some cases, to temporally or spectrally modify the light beam. The most common micro-optical elements are those that reflect, diffract or refract light. MOEMS is the manipulation of light in one, two, or three-dimensional space.

moir
An undesirable pattern that appears when a graphic image is displayed or printed with an inappropriate resolution. Moiré patterns are difficult to predict because they result from a complex combination of parameters: the size of the image, resolution of the image, resolution of the output device, halftone screen angle, etc.  If you're planning to print a graphic image (particularly a bit-mapped image) on a high-resolution printer, it's a good idea to print a test page first to see if there are any moiré patterns. If there are, you can sometimes eliminate them by changing the resolution of the printout, resizing the image, or changing the angle of the halftone screen.  

Molex
A form of plastic invented in the 1930s by the Molex company. The material was developed by the late Frederick August Krehbiel. In 1938, he founded the Molex Products Company in Brookfield, Ill. to manufacture a variety of products from this material, including clock cases, flower pots, valve wheels and salt tablet dispensers.  In the 1950s, Molex rapidly penetrated the appliance market with its low-cost connector terminal blocks. The company launched its first plug and receptacle connector line in 1953. In 1960, the company introduced its first nylon plug and receptacle line, marking its evolution from a manufacturer of a material called Molex to an electronics corporation named Molex. [Source: Molex Web site]  Today when the word Molex is used by the computer enthusiast it is used to refer to the standard power connectors found in modern computers. It is the nylon plug and receptacle; a plastic end to which four wires are attached and are used for connecting many devices such as hard disks, CD-ROMs, graphics cards, storage devices, and more.

monetization
In Web development the term monetization is used to mean the ability to generate a revenue thorough your Web site or blog. Monetization can be from affiliate programs, electronic commerce, premium content, advertising or any form of revenue generation.

mongodb
Derived from the word humongous, MongoDB is a scalable and high-performance open source database designed to handle document-oriented storage. MongoDB was written in C++ and features replication & High Availability, mirror across LANs and WANs for scale, auto-sharing, rich querying and more.

monitor
(1) Another term for display screen. The term monitor, however, usually refers to the entire box, whereas display screen can mean just the screen. In addition, the term monitor often implies graphics capabilities.
There are many ways to classify monitors. The most basic is in terms of color capabilities, which separates monitors into three classes:

monochrome : Monochrome monitors actually display two colors, one for the background and one for the foreground. The colors can be black and white, green and black, or amber and black.
gray-scale :A gray-scale monitor is a special type of monochrome monitor capable of displaying different shades of gray.
color: Color monitors can display anywhere from 16 to over 1 million different colors. Color monitors are sometimes called RGB monitors because they accept three separate signals -- red, green, and blue.

Screen Size
After this classification, the most important aspect of a monitor is its screen size. Like televisions, screen sizes are measured in diagonal inches, the distance from one corner to the opposite corner diagonally. A typical size for small VGA monitors is 14 inches. Monitors that are 16 or more inches diagonally are often called full-page monitors.

monitor_footprint
A term used to reference how much space a monitor takes up on your desk.

monitoring_software
Software for monitoring the desktop and online activities of employees, family members, roommates or other users of a computer. Sometimes referred to as parental control software, monitoring software can quietly monitor and log PC and online activities or more actively filter content and block offensive websites from being accessed.
It isn't always easy to distinguish monitoring software from spyware, which is why at least one of the following criteria must be met in order for the installation of monitoring software to be considered legal:


The owner of the software must also be the owner of the computer it is going to be installed on
The owner of the software must be the parent of a minor child
The owner of the software must have the consent of all users of the monitored computer



Monitter
Monitter is the name of a free Twitter tool that lets users monitter the Twitter service for a set of three keywords. Monitter then shows you what people are tweeting for the keywords.  See also "Twitter Dictionary: A guide to help you understand Twitter chatter and slang" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

Mono
(1) Also referred to as the Mono Project, a development initiative sponsored by Ximian to create an open source Unix version of Microsoft��s .NET development platform. Mono focuses just on the development platform (a runtime for the Common Language Infrastructure, a compiler for C# and a set of class libraries) and not the end user applications that the term .NET also refers to. Mono is named for the Spanish word for monkey. (2) Abbreviation for monophonic sound.

monochromatic_colors
Refers to a single hue in a color palette that is expanded upon by adding two, three, or more tints (variations in lightness and saturation) of that color, to create a more balanced look. In desktop publishing using monochromatic colors is a technique used to vary color in the print document without paying to add additional colors. See "The Science of Color" in the Did You Know... section of Webopedia. See also Webopedia's  Digital Camera Quick Reference.

monochrome
Monochrome means one color. 
Typically one color is presented in different values and intensities — or different shades of the single color.


monomer
A single molecule that has the ability to combine with identical or similar molecules, a process also known as polymerization.

monophonic_ringtone
In mobile phone technology a monophonic ringtone is a type of ringtone which consists of a series of notes, one musical note at a time. Contrast with  polyphonic ringtone which consists of several notes at one time.

monophonic_sound
Commonly called mono sound, mono, or non-stereo sound, this early sound system used a single channel of audio for sound output. In monophonic sound systems, the signal sent to the sound system encodes one single stream of sound and it usually uses just one speaker. Monophonic sound is the most basic format of sound output. Contrast with stereophonic sound, which uses two channels.

monospacing
Refers to fonts in which each character has the same width. The opposite of monospacing is proportional spacing, in which different characters have different widths. For example, in a proportionally spaced font, the letter o would be wider than the letter i. Proportionally spaced fonts look more professional, but monospaced fonts are often superior for tabular data because the uniform width of each character makes alignment of columns easier.  Most printed matter, including this book, uses proportional spacing.  

Monster_Cable_Products_Inc
Monster Cable Products Inc. was founded in 1979 by Noel Lee, who was then a laser-fusion design engineer at Lawrence-Livermore Laboratory, as well as an audiophile and professional drummer. Lee discovered that wires of different constructions produced varying degrees of audio performance when hooked up to loudspeakers. From this discovery, he developed a high performance speaker cable, named it Monster Cable, and literally created an industry. Monster is now the world's leading manufacturer of high performance cables that connect audio/video components for home, car and professional use as well as computers and computer games.

MOO
Short for Mud, Object Oriented, a specific implementation of a MUD system developed by Stephen white. MOO is in the public domain and can be freely downloaded and executed. 

moonOS
A Ubuntu-based distro that offers the LXDE and Enlightenment 17 desktop managers and imaginative, original artwork. The moonOS project was created by Cambodian artist Chanrithy Thim. MoonOS is an operating system for the desktop, laptop or virtual machine.

Moores_Law
(n.) The observation made in 1965 by Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had doubled every year since the integrated circuit was invented. Moore predicted that this trend would continue for the foreseeable future. In subsequent years, the pace slowed down a bit, but data density has doubled approximately every 18 months, and this is the current definition of Moore's Law, which Moore himself has blessed. Most experts, including Moore himself, expect Moore's Law to hold for at least another two decades.

mopy
A slang term that combines the words multiple original prints (plus the "y" from the word "copy"). The term is used to refer to the increasing use of fast, multifunction printers (MFPs) to create multiple original copies of documents, as opposed to using photo copiers. When using MFPs, the word mopy can replaces the common word copy, where the equipment would be referred to as a  mopier (instead of copier). See multifunction peripheral for definition of this device.

morphing
Short for metamorphosing, morphing refers to an animation technique in which one image is gradually turned into another. Many advanced animation programs support some type of morphing feature.


morto
Monto is computer worm that spreads via the Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and infects Microsoft Windows workstations and servers. Morto first appeared publically in August 2011, when network administrators started noticing heavy spikes in traffic on Port 3389/TCP.
Once Morto infects one computer on a network, the worm scans for other machines that have RDP enabled and copies itself to these computers' local drives as a DLL file, which then creates additional files on the computers.  The Morto worm can also be controlled remotely.  At least two variants of the Morto worm are currently known to security experts.

MOS
In voice telephony the term MOS, or mean opinion score is a measurement of the quality of human speech at the destination end of the circuit. MOS is expressed as a single number in the range of 1 (lowest perceived quality) to 5 (highest perceived quality). The MOS is an important factor in determining the QoS.

Mosaic
An application that simplifies accessing documents on the World Wide Web. Originally produced by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), Mosaic has always been distributed as freeware. In 1994, however, the NCSA turned over commercial development of the program to a company called Spyglass. There are now several varieties of Mosaic, some free and some for sale.  

MOSFET
Pronounced MAWS-feht. Acronym for metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor, a common type of transistor in which charge carriers, such as electrons, flow along channels. The width of the channel, which determines how well the device conducts, is controlled by an electrode called the gate, separated from channel by a thin layer of oxide insulation. The insulation keeps current from flowing between the gate and channel.  MOSFETs are useful for high-speed switching applications and also on integrated circuits in computers.

Mosquito
A type of cellphone virus that became known in 2004. Mosquito was distributed as a part of a downloadable game. It makes mobile phones to send text messages to premium-rate numbers without the user's approval or knowledge.

mote
Short for remote and refers to a wireless transceiver that is also a remote sensor.

motherboard
The main circuit board of a microcomputer. The motherboard contains the connectors for attaching additional boards. Typically, the motherboard contains the CPU, BIOS, memory, mass storage interfaces, serial and parallel ports, expansion slots, and all the controllers required to control standard peripheral devices, such as the display screen, keyboard, and disk drive. Collectively, all these chips that reside on the motherboard are known as the motherboard's chipset.
On most PCs, it is possible to add memory chips directly to the motherboard. You may also be able to upgrade to a faster PC by replacing the CPU chip. To add additional core features, you may need to replace the motherboard entirely.
Motherboard is sometimes abbreviated as mobo.

motherboard_plate
(1) Any type of metal or plastic plate designed to fit over a device or computer component to enhance the device's functionality or its looks. Cellphones, iPods and even handheld game devices are types consumer electronics that consumers can purchase faceplates for. These faceplates, usually snap on plates, can change the way the device looks, enabling consumers to change the design to better suit their own tastes and personalities. See also "The Difference Between a Cell Phone, Smartphone and PDA" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. (2) A motherboard plate, also called a faceplate, is a metal plate that fits over a motherboard's ports to supply a secure casing around the ports. A motherboard's faceplate helps keep the motherboard enclosed within a PC and helps prevent dust from accumulating on the motherboard. Some manufacturers provide faceplates with motherboards and others do not. Faceplates typically are installed into the back of a computer's case. 

motif
A set of user interface guidelines created by the Open Software Foundation (www.opengroup.org) that specify how an application should look and feel, covering issues like the placement of title bars and menus. It is used on more than 200 hardware and software platforms and has become the standard graphical user interface (GUI ) for UNIX.   

motion_compensation_and_prediction
In video editing motion compensation provides a prediction for the macroblock. When prediction is applied, the DCT is applied to conform to the prediction errors instead of to image samples. Good motion compensation prediction will result in a lower bit rate and still maintain decent quality. Also called motion compensated prediction.

motion_detection
In video surveillance, motion detection refers to the capability of the surveillance system to detect motion and capture the events. Motion detection is usually a software-based monitoring  algorithm which, when it detects motions will signal the surveillance camera to begin capturing the event. Also called  activity detection. An advanced motion detection surveillance system can analyze the type of motion to see if it warrants an alarm.

motion_estimation
In video editing motion estimation is a type of video compression scheme. The motion estimation process is done by the coder to find the motion vector pointing to the best prediction macroblock in a reference frame or field. For compression redundancy between adjacent frames can be exploited where a frame is selected as a reference and subsequent frames are predicted from the reference using motion estimation. The motion estimation process analyzes previous or future frames to identify blocks that have not changed, and motion vectors are stored in place of blocks. The process of video compression using motion estimation is also known as  interframe coding.

motion_vector
In video editing motion vectors are used to compress video by storing the changes to an image from one  frame to the next. The process is a bi-dimensional pointer that communicates to the decoder how much left or right and up or down, the prediction macroblock is located from the position of the macroblock in the reference frame or field.

motion_JPEG
JPEG stands for the Joint Photographic Experts Group standard, a standard for storing and compressing digital images. Motion-JPEG extends this standard by supporting videos. In motion-JPEG, each frame in the video is stored with the JPEG format.   

Motorola_microprocessors
Motorola Inc. is one of the leading manufacturers of microprocessors. Until the early 1990s, Motorola microprocessors were used in all Apple Macintosh computers and in many workstations. Following the development of its 68040 chip in 1989, however, Motorola changed its focus from the 680x0 line of CISC chips to RISC technologies. In 1993, Motorola joined Apple Computer and IBM in designing a new RISC architecture that would form the basis of the next generation of personal computers. This effort culminated in the introduction of the PowerPC architecture in 1994.  There are five main chips in the 680x0 family: the 6800, 68020, 68030, 68040 and 68060. Many people refer to them by their last three digits. For example, the "oh-forty" refers to the 68040 chip.  

mount
(1) To make a mass storage device available. In Macintosh environments, for example, inserting a floppy disk into the drive is called mounting the floppy.  (2) To install a device, such as a disk drive or expansion board.  

Mount_Rainier
Mount Rainier is a standard that provides background formatting and defect management for storage on CD-RW and DVD+RW. This makes rewritable discs easier to use and allows the replacement of the floppy.  On Mount Rainier CD-RW and DVD+RW drives you can drag-and-drop files to the RW disc and the real formatting of the disc is done in the background (invisible to the user). Also, if there are scratches on the disc the drive will recognize this and will replace the bad areas.  Also called Mount Rainier Writing (MRW).

mountain_lion_server
Mountain Lion Server is the business-oriented server version of Apple Computer's Mac OS X Mountain Lion (v10.8) operating system.  Like its predecessors, Snow Leopard Server and Lion Server, Mountain Lion Server represents Apple's successor and replacement for the company's older enterprise-grade server product, Xserve, which Apple discontinued in 2011.  Unlike Xserve, Mac OS X Mountain Lion Server and its simplified deployment and administration capabilities are focused more toward small businesses than enterprises.  To that end, Mountain Lion Server enables collaboration and file sharing among users while also facilitating backups across multiple computers, remote administration, website and mail server hosting and more.  Mac OS X Mountain Lion Server launched on July 25, 2012 through the Mac App Store in the form of a $19.99 OS X Server App that upgrades the standard Mac OS X Mountain Lion operating system.

mouse
)A device that controls the movement of the cursor or pointer on a display screen. A mouse is a small object you can roll along a hard, flat surface. Its name is derived from its shape, which looks a bit like a mouse, its connecting wire that one can imagine to be the mouse's tail, and the fact that one must make it scurry along a surface. As you move the mouse, the pointer on the display screen moves in the same direction. Mice contain at least one button and sometimes as many as three, which have different functions depending on what program is running. Some newer mice also include a scroll wheelfor scrolling through long documents.
Invented by Douglas Engelbart of Stanford Research Center in 1963, and pioneered by Xerox in the 1970s, the mouse is one of the great breakthroughs in computer  ergonomics because it frees the user to a large extent from using the keyboard. In particular, the mouse is important for graphical user interfaces because you can simply point to options and objects and click a mouse button. Such applications are often called point-and-click programs. The mouse is also useful for graphicsprograms that allow you to draw pictures by using the mouse like a pen, pencil, or paintbrush.
There are three basic types of mice:

mouse_hover
A mouse hover, also called just hover, triggers an event when a user places a mouse over a designated area, such as a hyperlink on a Web page. The action of moving the mouse over the item causes events such as pop-up windows or description boxes. Hovers can be coded into Web pages using DHTML, JavaScript and other means. Usually, if the function uses JavaScript it is called a mouseover.

mouseover
A JavaScript element that triggers a change on an item (typically a graphic change, such as making an image or hyperlink appear ) in a Web page when the pointer passes over it. The change usually signifies that the item is a link to related or additional information. Mouseovers are widely used in Navigation Bars, pop-up windows, and/or form submissions.  Mouseovers require JavaScript in two places of an HTML document. At the beginning of your document and before the BODY tag, JavaScript defines the event to take place. After the BODY tag, HTML code contains the actual mouseover element in the place on your Web page you want the action to take place. When your mouse passes over the HTML code containing the mouseover element, it signals the JavaScript event to take place. 

mousepad
A pad over which you can move a mouse. Mousepads provide more traction than smooth surfaces such as glass and wood, so they make it easier to move a mouse accurately.  For mechanical mice, mousepads are optional. Optical mice, however, require special mousepads that have grids drawn on them.  

mousetrap
A technique that forces a user to remain on a specific Web site by not allowing the user to leave the site. Whenever the user tries to leave the site by closing the browser window or going to a new URL, the site that is mousetrapping will automatically open a new browser window with its URL or not allow the browser to go to the new URL. Some mousetraps only will open a limited number of new browser windows and eventually will let the persevering user leave the site; other mousetraps will open new browser windows ad infinitum, and the only way to get out of the trap is to press "Ctrl+Alt+Del" to end the task or reboot the computer if that fails.  Additionally, there are software programs that prevent mousetrapping.

MOV
Apple QuickTime Movie file format. See Data Formats and Their File Extensions in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

moved_to_Atlanta
(slang) A reference to Web pages that disappear and leave only "404 File Not Found" errors in their place. The reference comes from the telephone area code of Atlanta, Georgia, which is 404. Web pages that produce 404 errors are said to have "moved to Atlanta." See also "Web Server Error Messages" in the  Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

movie_mode
In digital camera terminology, movie mode is a function of the digital camera that enables your digital camera to capture moving subjects in a video format. Most digital cameras come with a movie mode that records both video and also sound. Video captured on a digital camera is not as good of quality as the video captured on a camcorder or other digital video recording device.  See also "Digital Cameras" in the  Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

moving_bar_menu
A common type of menu in which options are selected by moving a highlighted bar over them. You can move the bar with a mouse or with arrow keys, or sometimes with the Tab key.  

Mozilla
The original name for Netscape's browser, now called Navigator. Some people claim that the term is a contraction of Mosaic Godzilla (e.g., Mosaic killer), since Mosaic was the number one Web browser at the time Netscape began developing its product. The term Mozilla is still used by many Web developers and appears in server log files that identify the browsers being used.  In 1998, Netscape decided to make the source code for Navigator freely available to the public, or open source. The Netscape group responsible for releasing the code is called mozilla.org, and its Web site is www.mozilla.org. Learn more about  Open Source in Webopedia's "Did You Know...?" section.

Mozilla_Thunderbird
Mozilla Thunderbird is a cross-platform, open source e-mail client that competes with the likes of Microsoft Outlook and Eudora Mail.  Mozilla Thunderbird originated as an offshoot of the Mozilla Firefox Web browser project and was developed by the same team until Mozilla Corporation released development to an independent organization in order to focus efforts on Firefox.
 
Like Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird supports add-ons, extensions that provide additional functionality to the e-mail client.  One of the key extensions available for Mozilla Thunderbird is Mozilla Lightning, an extension that adds calendar and personal information manager (PIM) capabilities to Thunderbird.

mozy
An online data backup provider offering enterprise, small business and consumer-level services. Mozy was initially a service for consumers but has extended its capabilities into the small business arena via MozyPro, which can be obtained through small business resellers or direct from the company.
Mozy allows users to centrally administer all backups so that they happen automatically and you can also set rules for each machine to determine the types of files you want to backup. 
Also see online backup.Learn more about MozyPro in this Small Business Computing article.

MP
Short for Multilink Point-to-Point Protocol, an extension to the PPP protocol that allows multiple physical connections between two points to be combined into a single logical connection. The combined connections, called a bundle, provide greater bandwidth than a single connection.  Unlike channel bonding, which usually combines two channels for the duration of a connection, MP supports dynamic bandwidth allocation, which means that physical links can be added or removed from the bundle as needed.  MP works with a number of technologies, including ISDN, X.25 and Frame Relay. It is an open standard, specified in RFC 1990. 

MP1
MPEG Audio Stream, Layer I file format. See Data Formats and Their File Extensions in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

MP2

Data Files Related Terminology
The following data files and formats glossary will help you to better understand how files are stored and are accessed on your computer.
What is a File Format?
File format is a format for encoding information in a file. Each different type of file has a different file format. The file format specifies first whether the file is a binary or ASCII file, and second, how the information is organized.

MP3
MP3 is the name of the file extension and also the common name of the type of file for MPEG-1 audio layer 3. Today, MP3 is the common audio format for consumer audio streaming and storage and the standard for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players. Because MP3 files are small, they can easily be transferred across the Internet.
What is MPEG Audio Layer 3?
Layer 3 is one of three coding schemes (layer 1, layer 2 and layer 3) for the compression of audio signals. Layer 3 uses perceptual audio coding and psychoacoustic compression to remove all superfluous information (more specifically, the redundant and irrelevant parts of a sound signal. The stuff the human ear doesn't hear anyway). It also adds a MDCT (Modified Discrete Cosine Transform) that implements a filter bank, increasing the frequency resolution 18 times higher than that of layer 2.
The result in real terms is layer 3 shrinks the original sound data from a CD (with a bit rateof 1411.2 kilobits per one second of stereo music) by a factor of 12 (down to 112-128kbps) without sacrificing sound quality.

MP3_player
A portable consumer electronic device that allows you to store and plays music files in MP3 format. MP3 players are small handheld devices and often use flash memory for storing MP3 files. While frequently called an MP3 player, it fits under the broader category of digital audio players and often an MP3 players can use other file types such as Windows Media Audio (WMA). See "iPod vs. MP3 Players: What's the Diff?"in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia.

Data Files Related Terminology
The following data files and formats glossary will help you to better understand how files are stored and are accessed on your computer.
What is a File Format?
File format is a format for encoding information in a file. Each different type of file has a different file format. The file format specifies first whether the file is a binary or ASCII file, and second, how the information is organized.

MPC
Abbreviation of Multimedia Personal Computer, a software and hardware standard developed by a consortium of computer firms led by Microsoft. There are three MPC standards, called MPC, MPC2, and MPC3, respectively. Each specifies a minimum hardware configuration for running multimedia software.  To run MPC-2 software, you need at least an Intel 486SX microprocessor with a clock speed of 25 MHz, 4 MB (megabytes) of RAM, a VGA display, and a double-speed CD-ROM drive.  MPC3 specifies the following minimum configuration:  8 MB RAM 540 MB disk drive 75 MHz Pentium processor 4X CD-Rom MPEG support     

MPEG
Short for Moving Picture Experts Group, and pronounced m-peg, is a working group of the ISO. The term also refers to the family of digital video compression standards and file formats developed by the group. MPEG generally produces better-quality video than competing formats, such as Video for Windows,  Indeo and QuickTime. MPEG files previously on PCs needed hardware decoders (codecs) for MPEG processing. Today, however, PCs can use  software-only codecsincluding products from RealNetworks, QuickTime or Windows Media Player.
MPEG algorithms compress data to form small bits that can be easily transmitted and then decompressed. MPEG achieves its high compression rate by storing only the changes from one frame to another, instead of each entire frame. The video information is then  encoded using a technique called Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). MPEG uses a type of lossy compression, since some data is removed. But the diminishment of data is generally imperceptible to the human eye.   The major MPEG standards include the following;

MPEG-1: The most common implementations of the MPEG-1 standard provide a video resolution of 352-by-240 at 30 frames per second (fps). This produces video quality slightly below the quality of conventional VCR videos.
MPEG-2: Offers resolutions of 720x480 and 1280x720 at 60 fps, with full CD-quality audio. This is sufficient for all the major TV standards, including NTSC, and even HDTV. MPEG-2 is used by DVD-ROMs. MPEG-2 can compress a 2 hour video into a few gigabytes. While decompressing an MPEG-2 data stream requires only modest computing power, encoding video in MPEG-2 format requires significantly more processing power.
MPEG-3: Was designed for HDTV but was abandoned in place of using MPEG-2 for HDTV.
MPEG-4: A graphics and video compression algorithm standard that is based on MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 and Apple QuickTime technology. Wavelet-based MPEG-4 files are smaller than JPEG or QuickTime files, so they are designed to transmit video and images over a narrower bandwidth and can mix video with text, graphics and 2-D and 3-D animation layers. MPEG-4 was standardized in October 1998 in the ISO/IEC document 14496. See MPEG-4.
MPEG-7: Formally called the Multimedia Content Description Interface, MPEG-7 provides a tool set for completely describing multimedia content. MPEG-7 is designed to be generic and not targeted to a specific application.
MPEG-21: Includes a Rights Expression Language (REL) and a Rights Data Dictionary. Unlike other MPEG standards that describe compression coding methods, MPEG-21 describes a standard that defines the description of content and also processes for accessing, searching, storing and protecting the copyrights of content. See  MPEG-21.


MPEG_21
A comprehensive standard framework for networked digital multimedia designed by the Moving Picture Experts Group. MPEG-21 includes an REL and a Rights Data Dictionary. Unlike other MPEG standards that describe compression coding methods, MPEG-21 describes a standard that defines the description of content and also processes for accessing, searching, storing and protecting the copyrights of content.

MPEG_4
A graphics and video lossy compression algorithm standard that is based on MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 and Apple QuickTime technology. Wavelet-based MPEG-4 files are smaller than JPEG or QuickTime files, so they are designed to transmit video and images over a narrower bandwidth and can mix video with text, graphics and 2-D and 3-D animation layers. Wavelet technology can compress color images at rates of 20:1 up to 300:1 and grayscale images at 20:1 to 50:1. MPEG-4 was standardized in October 1998 in the ISO/IEC document 14496.
Also see MPEG.

MPICH2
MPICH2 is an implementation of the  Message Passing Interface (MPI). The goals of MPICH2 are to provide an MPI implementation for important platforms, including clusters, SMPs and massively parallel processors. It also provides a tool for MPI implementation research and for developing new and better parallel programming environments. MPICH2 replaces MPICH1. [Source: MPICH2 Web page]
See also Message Passing Interface (MPI).

MPLS
MPLS is short for Multiprotocol Label Switching.
MPLS is an IETF initiative that integrates Layer 2 information about network links (e.g. bandwidth, latency, utilization) into Layer 3 (IP) within a particular autonomous system, or ISP, in order to simplify and improve IP packet exchange. MPLS gives network operators a great deal of flexibility to divert and route traffic around link failures, congestion, and bottlenecks.
From a quality of service QoS standpoint, ISPs will better be able to manage different kinds of data streams based on priority and service plan. For instance, those who subscribe to a premium service plan, or those who receive a lot of streaming media or high-bandwidth content can see minimal latency and packet loss.

MPOA
Short for Multiprotocol Over ATM, a specification that enables ATM services to be integrated with existing local-area networks (LANs) that use Ethernet, token-ring or TCP/IP protocols. The goal of MPOA is to allow different LANs to send packets to each other via an ATM backbone. Unlike other techniques, such as LAN Emulation (LANE), which operates at level 2 of the OSI Reference Model, MPOA operates at Level 3. 

MPOE
Short for minimum point of entry, the closest practical point to where the cables of a telecommunications service carrier (i.e., a phone or cable company) cross a property line or where its wiring enters a multi-unit building. The MPOE of a multi-unit building is typically 12 inches inside the building��s foundation.

MPP
Short for massively parallel processing, a type of computing that uses many separate CPUs running in parallel to execute a single program. MPP is similar to symmetric processing (SMP), with the main difference being that in SMP systems all the CPUs share the same memory, whereas in MPP systems, each CPU has its own memory. MPP systems are therefore more difficult to program because the application must be divided in such a way that all the executing segments can communicate with each other. On the other hand, MPP don't suffer from the bottleneck problems inherent in SMP systems when all the CPUs attempt to access the same memory at once. 

MPU
Short for micro processor unit. More commonly called the microprocessor.

MPV

What is a File Format?
File format is a format for encoding information in a file. Each different type of file has a different file format. The file format specifies first whether the file is a binary or ASCII file, and second, how the information is organized.

MRAM
Short for magnetoresistive RAM, or magnetic RAM, a non-volatile RAM memory technology that uses magnetic charges to store data instead of electric charges, such as those used in SRAM and DRAM technologies.  Unlike a technology such as DRAM, which requires a constant flow of electricity to maintain the integrity of the data, MRAM will retain data even when the power is turned off and only requires a small amount of electricity to store data bits. For example, in a PC enabled with MRAM, the computer would start up instantly instead of having to wait for the BIOS to locate and load the computer��s operating system software.  Technically, MRAM works by placing millions of magnetic "sandwiches" on a silicon substrate, with tiny parallel wires running in one direction on top of them and more perpendicular wires running below, creating a woven effect in the wiring. A single bit is represented at each point where the top and bottom wires cross. To write a bit onto the chip, a current passes through a wire on top of the sandwich and flips the polarity on one of the magnets. To read a bit from a chip, a current travels through the structure and measures the resistance of each magnet. Low resistance equals "0" and high resistance equals "1." The sandwiches remain in their magnetic states until the data is rewritten or erased by the system.  MRAM, first developed by IBM in the 1970s, is expected to replace DRAM as the memory standard in electronics.

ms
(1) When spelled ms, short for millisecond, one thousandth of a second. Access times of mass storage devices are often measured in milliseconds.  (2) When spelled MS, short for Microsoft.  (3) When spelled MS, it is also short for mobile subscribers.

MS_FrontPage
Microsoft FrontPage, a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation. A software program to create and manage Web pages.

MSA_RSA
Short for metropolitan statistical area/rural service area, cellular service areas used by the FCC to license cellular telephone service. There are 306 MSAs and 428 RSAs. Every county in the United States is assigned to one of these markets.  MSAs -- originally used by the US government for grouping census data -- include cities of at least 50,000 people, or urbanized areas of at least 100,000 people and the counties that include these areas.  RSAs include all areas not part of MSAs. These are often rural areas.  In order for a carrier to provide service to specific MSAs and RSAs, it must have a FCC license. If the carrier did receive the license at the time of auction, then it must try to buy it from the successful bidder or create a deal with the rightful owner that allows it to serve that particular area. Multiple licenses are given out per MSA/RSA, and each carrier must transmit over its assigned frequency.  If a carrier can't build a system to serve a certain percentage of the licensed area by a specified deadline date, then it must return the license to the FCC. 

MSCDEX
Short for Microsoft CD-ROM Extension, a driver that enables DOS and Windows 3.x systems to recognize and control CD-ROM players. The driver is located in a file called MSCDEX.EXE. Windows 95 replaces MSCDEX with a 32-bit, dynamically loadable driver called CDFS. 

MSCONFIG
Built into Windows 98, 98SE, ME, and XP, MSCONFIG or  the  Microsoft System Configuration Utility is a tool designed to help you troubleshoot problems with your computer. MSCONFIG  allows you to edit your start-up applications and provides access to the SYSTEM.INI, WIN.INI, amd BOOT.INI files.  To launch the MSCONFIG to go to:  START -> RUN -> type MSCONFIG -> [ENTER] 

MSCS
Short for Microsoft Cluster Server, a clustering technology built into Windows NT 4.0 and later versions. MSCS supports clustering of two NT servers to provide a single fault-tolerant server.  During its development stage, MSCS was code-named Wolfpack. 

MSISDN
Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number (MSISDN) is a number used to identify a mobile phone number internationally. MSISDN is defined by the E.164 numbering plan. This number includes a country code and a National Destination Code which identifies the subscriber's operator.

MSN
Short for Microsoft Network, Microsoft's online service. Like competing services such as America Online, MSN offers e-mail, topic-related forums, and full access to the World Wide Web. 

MSN_Direct
A service that broadcasts information to a variety of compatible electronic devices such as watches and appliances. This broadcast service includes information options such as traffic routes, gas prices, weather reports, stock prices and more. MSN Direct uses the Microsoft DirectBand wireless data casting network to broadcast information. See also Microsoft Smart Personal Object Technology Information.

MSO
Acronym for multiple system operators.
Multiple System Operators (MSO) is a term used in the cable industry to describe a company which owns and operates two or more cable TV systems.

MSRP
Short for manufacturer's suggested retail price, MSRP is the term used to mean the price at which a developer or manufacturer will recommend a retailer sell a product for. MSRP may also be abbreviated as MRP for manufacturer's suggested price. Also called sticker price.

MSS
Short for Maximum Segment Size. The maximum segment size (MSS) is the largest amount of data, specified in bytes, that a computer or communications device can handle in a single, unfragmented piece. * Each TCP device has associated with it a ceiling on TCP size  a segment size that will never be exceeded regardless of how large the current window is. This is called the maximum segment size (MSS). When deciding how much data to put into a segment, each device in the TCP connection will choose the amount based on the current window size, in conjunction with the various algorithms, but it will never be so large that the amount of data exceeds the MSS of the device to which it is sending.  [* Source: Adapted from the TCP/IP Guide] See also Maximum  Transmission Unit (MTU).

MT_RJ
Short for Mechanical Transfer Registered Jack, MT-RJ is a fiber optics connector popular for small form factor devices due to its small size. The MT-RJ uses a form factor and latch like the  RJ-45 and it supports full duplex.

MTBF
Short for mean time between failures, the average time a device will function before failing. MTBF ratings are measured in hours and indicate the sturdiness of hard disk drives and printers.
Typical disk drives for personal computers have MTBF ratings of about 500,000 hours. This means that of all the drives tested, one failure occurred every 500,000 hours of testing. Disk drives are typically tested only a few hours, and it would be unlikely for a failure to occur during this short testing period. Because of this, MTBF ratings are also predicted based on product experience or by analyzing known factors such as raw data supplied by the manufacturer.

MTDL
Short for Mean Time until Data Loss, in data storage, MTDL is the average time until a component failure can be expected to cause data loss.

MTS
(1) Short for Methods for Testing and Specification.  (2) Short for Microsoft Transaction Server, a feature of the Microsoft Windows NT Server operating system that allows the development and deployment of server-centric applications built using Microsoft Component Object Model (COM) technologies.  (3) Short for Measured Telephone Service, a telecommunication service based on metered usage such as toll-based calling. (4) Short for Multichannel Television Sound, the method of broadcasting stereo sound over ordinary analog TV channels. MTS reception capability is built into virtually all stereo TVs and HiFi VCRs.  (5) Abbreviation for Multithreaded Server, an Oracle server configuration that uses less memory. A dispatcher process enables many user processes to share a few server processes. While running in MTS mode, a user can still request a dedicated server process.

MTTR
Short for Mean Time To Repair, in data storage, MTTR is the average time before an electronic component can be expected to require repair.

MTU
Short for Maximum Transmission Unit, the largest physical packet size, measured in bytes, that a networkcan transmit. Any messages larger than the MTU are divided into smaller packets before being sent.
Every network has a different MTU, which is set by the network administrator. On Windows 95, you can also set the MTU of your machine. This defines the maximum size of the packets sent from your computer onto the network. Ideally, you want the MTU to be the same as the smallest MTU of all the networks between your machine and a message's final destination. Otherwise, if your messages are larger than one of the intervening MTUs, they will get broken up (fragmented), which slows down transmission speeds.
Trial and error is the only sure way of finding the optimal MTU, but there are some guidelines that can help. For example, the MTU of many PPP connections is 576, so if you connect to the Internet via PPP, you might want to set your machine's MTU to 576 too. Most Ethernetnetworks, on the other hand, have an MTU of 1500, which is the default MTU setting for Windows 95.

mu-mimo
Short for Multi-User, Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output, MU-MIMO is an enhanced form of the MIMO technology that enables multiple independent radio terminals to access a system, which can provide significant performance gains over the original MIMO technology.
MU-MIMO features prominently in the 2013 update of the 802.11ac wireless specification (802.11ac Wave 2) and helps increase theoretical maximum wireless speeds from 3.47 Gbps to 6.93 Gbps for 802.11ac Wave 2.  MU-MIMO enables multiple users to simultaneously access the same channel by providing spatial degrees of freedom. However, because of its need for sophisticated antenna systems and signal processing, MU-MIMO can only be used in the downstream direction (from an access point to multiple wireless client devices) in the 802.11ac Wave 2 specification.

MUA
Short for mail user agent, the software that allows a user to access and manage e-mail, including reading, composing, disposing, printing and displaying e-mail messages. The MUA provides the interface between the user and the MTA. Eudora and Outlook are two popular MUAs.

MUCK
Short for Multi-User Chat Kingdom, a text-based MUD system. MUCK is similar to MUSH, though it uses different software. 

MUD
Short for Multi-User Dungeon (or Multi-User Dimension) a cyberspace where users can take on an identity in the form of an avatar and interact with one another. Originally, MUDs tended to be adventure games played within enormous old castles with hidden rooms, trap-doors, exotic beasts, and magical items. Nowadays, the term is used more generically to refer to any cyberspace. MUDs are also known as 3-D worlds and chat worlds. 

multi_core_technology
In consumer technologies, multi-core is usually the term used to describe two or more CPUs working together on the same chip. Also called multicore technology, it is a type of architecture where a single physical processor contains the core logic of  two or more processors. These processors are packaged into a single integrated circuit (IC). These single integrated circuits are called a die. Multi-core can also refer to multiple dies packaged together. Multi-core enables the system to perform more tasks with a greater overall system performance.  Multi-core technology can be used in desktops, mobile PCs, servers and workstations. Contrast with dual-core, a single chip containing two separate processors (execution cores) in the same IC.   See "All About Dual-Core Processors" in the "Did You Know...?" section of Webopedia.

multi_port_memories
Multi-port memories are commonly used components in VLSI systems, such as register files in microprocessors, storage for media or network applications. The content of a multi-port memory can be accessed through different ports simultaneously. This feature is especially valuable for high speed processors, media processors, and communication processors. Multi-port memories require more testing effort since all ports have to be verified.  [Source:  Simulation-Based Test Algorithm Generation and Port Scheduling for MultiPort Memories (PDF)]

multi_tenant
In cloud computing, multi-tenant is the phrase used to describe multiple customers using the same public cloud.

multi_user
Refers to computer systems that support two or more simultaneous users. All mainframes and minicomputers are multi-user systems, but most personal computers and workstations are not. Another term for multi-user is time sharing.  

multi_user_interface
Multi-user interface typically refers to an operating system that allows concurrent access by multiple users on the system. For example on UNIX operating systems, two users can log in to the system at the same time.
Contrast with single-user interface. See also user interface.

multiangle
DVD videos, if recorded using more than one video track may allow viewers to select a different available camera angle from which to view the recording or film. The term multiangle describes the filming production method of recording different angles of the same scene by different cameras.

multiband_antenna
An antenna designed to operate on several bands. These antennas often use designs where one part of the antenna is active for one band, and another part is active for a different band. A multiband antenna may have lower than average gain or may be physically larger in compensation.

multicast
To transmit a single message to a select group of recipients. A simple example of multicasting is sending an e-mail message to a mailing list. Teleconferencing and videoconferencing also use multicasting, but require more robust protocols and networks.  Standards are being developed to support multicasting over a TCP/IP network such as the Internet. These standards, IP Multicast and Mbone, will allow users to easily join multicast groups.  Note that multicasting refers to sending a message to a select group whereas broadcasting refers to sending a message to everyone connected to a network.  The terms multicast and narrowcast are often used interchangeably, although narrowcast usually refers to the business model whereas multicast refers to the actual technology used to transmit the data.  Compare with unicast and anycast.

multicast_address
A multicast address is a single address that refers to multiple network devices. Multicast address is synonymous with group address.

multidimensional_DBMS
A database management system (DBMS) organized around groups of records that share a common field value. Multidimensional databases are often generated from relational databases. Whereas relational databases make it easy to work with individual records, multidimensional databases are designed for analyzing large groups of records.  The term OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) has become almost synonymous with multidimensional databases, whereas OLTP (On-Line Transaction Processing) generally refers to relational DBMSs.  

MultiFinder
The multitasking version of Finder for Apple Macintosh computers. This is the part of the operating system responsible for managing the desktop -- locating documents and folders and handling the Clipboard and Scrapbook. For System 6, and earlier versions of the Mac OS, MultiFinder was optional. Since System 7, MultiFinder has replaced the older Finder.   

multifrequency_monitor
A type of video monitor capable of accepting signals at more than one frequency range. This enables the monitor to support several different resolutions. Multifrequency monitors differ somewhat from multiscanning monitors. Multiscanning monitors can support video signals at any frequency level within its range, whereas multifrequency monitors support only a select number of frequency levels. However, because almost all video signals conform to one of a handful of video standards, the greater potential of multiscanning monitors is generally not utilized. Also see Northern vs. Southern Hemishpere Monitors in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia.

multiheaded_client
In instant messaging (IM) terminology, a multiheaded client is a desktop or Web-based application that can be used to connect to multiple IM network accounts from a single user interface. Trillian, for example, is one of the most well-known multiheaded clients. This client lets users connect to their accounts on multiple public IM networks including ICQ, AOL Instant Messenger, MSN Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger and IRC.  May also be called multi-headed client. See the page of "Text Messaging Abbreviations" in the  Quick Reference section of Webopedia. Also see "Public IM Services" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

multihomed
(adj.) Typically used to describe a host connected to two or more networks or having two or more network addresses. For example, a network server may be connected to a serial line and a LAN or to multiple LANs.

multilingual_videoconference
A videoconference in two or more languages with interpretation, either consecutive or simultaneous.

multimedia
The use of computers to present text, graphics, video, animation, and sound in an integrated way. Long touted as the future revolution in computing, multimedia applications were, until the mid-90s, uncommon due to the expensive hardware required. With increases in performance and decreases in price, however, multimedia is now commonplace. Nearly all PCs are capable of displaying video, though the resolution available depends on the power of the computer's video adapter and CPU.
 

multimedia_kit
A package of hardware and software that adds multimedia capabilities to a computer. Typically a multimedia kit includes a CD-ROM or DVD player, a sound card, speakers, and a bundle of CD-ROMs.  

Multimedia_Message_Service
Abbreviated as MMS, Multimedia Message Service is a store-and-forward method of transmitting graphics, video clips, sound files and short text messages over wireless networks using the WAP protocol. Carriers deploy special servers, dubbed MMS Centers (MMSCs) to implement the offerings on their systems. MMS also supports e-mail addressing, so the device can send e-mails directly to an e-mail address. The most common use of MMS is for communication between mobile phones.  MMS, however, is not the same as e-mail. MMS is based on the concept of multimedia messaging. The presentation of the message is coded into the presentation file so that the images, sounds and text are displayed in a predetermined order as one singular message. MMS does not support attachments as e-mail does.  To the end user, MMS is similar to SMS.

multimode_fiber
In fiber optics technology multimode fiber is used for signal transmission over short distances. In multimode fiber light waves are dispersed into numerous paths as they travel through the cable's core. Compare with singlemode fiber.

multipartite_virus
(mul´tē-pär´´tīt vī´rus) (n.) Also called a multi-part virus, a virus that attempts to attack both the boot sector and the executable, or program, files at the same time. When the virus attaches to the boot sector, it will in turn affect the system��s files, and when the virus attaches to the files, it will in turn infect the boot sector.  This type of virus can re-infect a system over and over again if all parts of the virus are not eradicated.

multiplayer
Multiplayer is a mode of play for computer games and video games where two or more gamers can play in the same game at the same time, co-operatively as a clan (or team) or head-to-head competitively (often referred to as deathmatch) . Multiplayer mode may be a split screen where the gamers play at the same time on one system, or where gamers play on separate systems connected to a LAN or Internet game server.Also see  All About Multiplayer PC Gaming in Webopedia's "Did You Know...?" section.

Multiple_Document_Interface
Abbreviated MDI, a Windows API that enables programmers to easily create applications with multiple windows. Each MDI application has a single main window, and any number of child windows. All child windows are displayed within the main window.  Although many programmers still use MDI, Microsoft recommends using a newer API called Single Document Interface (SDI). 

multiplexing
To combine multiple signals (analog or digital) for transmission over a single line or media. A common type of multiplexing combines several low-speed signals for transmission over a single high-speed connection. The following are several examples of different multiplexing methods:  Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) : each signal is assigned a different frequency Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) : each signal is assigned a fixed time slot in a fixed rotation Statistical Time Division Multiplexing (STDM): time slots are assigned to signals dynamically to make better use of bandwidth Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) : each signal is assigned a particular wavelength; used on optical fiber.   

multiplexor
A communications device that multiplexes (combines) several signals for transmission over a single medium. A demultiplexor completes the process by separating multiplexed signals from a transmission line. Frequently a multiplexor and demultiplexor are combined into a single device capable of processing both outgoing and incoming signals.  A multiplexor is sometimes called a mux and also spelled as multiplexer. 

multiplier_lock
The multiplier lock is used by CPU manufacturers to prevent consumers and dealers from overclocking the CPU. When overclocking became mainstream, profit margins for CPU manufacturers lowered because users wouldn't need to upgrade to a faster processor.   When locked, the multiplier--the factor by which the bus speed is multiplied to derive the CPU speed--is stuck at one given value, thus ruling out any overclocking on motherboards strictly built to the CPU manufacturers specifications. The lock is hard wired into the CPU and is very difficult to overcome.  

multipoint_control_unit
See MCU.

multipoint_videoconference
A videoconferencing with more than two sites. In order to connect the two sites a video bridge must be used.

multiprocessing
(1) Refers to a computer system's ability to support more than one process (program) at the same time. Multiprocessing operating systems enable several programs to run concurrently. UNIX is one of the most widely used multiprocessing systems, but there are many others, including OS/2 for high-end PCs. Multiprocessing systems are much more complicated than single-process systems because the operating system must allocate resources to competing processes in a reasonable manner.
(2) Refers to the utilization of multiple CPUs in a single computer system. This is also called parallel processing.


MultiRead
A new specification for CD-ROM and compact disc players that enables them to read discs created by CD-RW drives. The specification was developed jointly by Philips Electronics and Hewlett-Packard, and has been approved by the Optical Storage Technology Association (OSTA). 

multiscanning_monitor
A type of monitor that automatically adjusts to the signal frequency of the video display board to which it is connected. Consequently, multiscanning monitors can display images based on almost any graphics display system, including MDA, Hercules, EGA, VGA, and SVGA.  In contrast, fixed-frequency monitors respond to only one, or a few, frequencies, so they can connect to a limited number of video display boards. However, fixed-frequency monitors are less expensive than multiscanning monitors and sometimes produce sharper images.  Multiscanning monitors are also called multisync, multifrequency, and variable-frequency monitors. Increasingly, however, the term multifrequency monitor is reserved for monitors that support a fixed number of video frequencies. In contrast, multiscanning monitors scan the incoming signals and set themselves to whatever frequency range they are receiving. In practice, there is little difference between the two types of monitors because most video signals conform to one of a handful of video standards.  Also see Northern vs. Southern Hemishpere Monitors in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia.  

multisystem
In video devices, a multisystem is one that is capable of receiving and displaying different video formats. A multisystem TV or VCR for example would be able to display PAL, SECAM, NTSC or any combination. Most multisystem devices also offer dual voltage sources so they can be used almost anywhere in the world.

multitasking
The ability to execute more than one task at the same time, a task being a program. The terms multitasking and multiprocessing are often used interchangeably, although multiprocessing implies that more than one CPUis involved.
In multitasking, only one CPU is involved, but it switches from one program to another so quickly that it gives the appearance of executing all of the programs at the same time.
There are two basic types of multitasking: preemptive and cooperative. In preemptive multitasking, the operating system parcels out CPU time slices to each program. In cooperative multitasking, each program can control the CPU for as long as it needs it. If a program is not using the CPU, however, it can allow another program to use it temporarily. OS/2, Windows 95, Windows NT, the Amiga operating system and UNIX use preemptive multitasking, whereas Microsoft Windows 3.x and the MultiFinder (for Macintosh computers) use cooperative multitasking.

multithreading
The ability of an operating system to execute different parts of a program, called threads, simultaneously. The programmer must carefully design the program in such a way that all the threads can run at the same time without interfering with each other.


mumblehard-malware
Mumblehard is a strain of malware that primarily targets web servers running Linux and BSD operating systems and surreptitiously uses the infected systems as spamming bots.
The security firm ESET discovered the Mumblehard malware in April 2015, but there is evidence of the malware remaining under the radar for at least the past five years. ESET gave the malware the Mumblehard moniker because it "mutters spam from your servers," according to the security research firm.
How Mumblehard Works and How to Prevent It from Starting
The Mumblehard malware exploits vulnerabilities in Wordpress and Joomla to execute two components written in Perl. The first component is a backdoor that requests commands from the malware's command and control server, and the second is a spammer daemon that can be launched via a command received by the backdoor.

MUMPS
Short for Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multiprogramming System, a general-purpose programming language developed in the late 1960s. MUMPS is similar to other procedural languages developed in this period, such as BASIC, FORTRAN, and C. A MUMPS standard was approved by ANSI in 1977.  Although MUMPS has never achieved the popularity level of other languages such as C and BASIC, there is still an active community of MUMPS developers. Since about 1993, there has been a growing trend to change the name from MUMPS to M or M-Technology. 

munging
(MUHN-jing) Munging (address munging), is the act of altering an email address posted on a Web page to make it unreadable to bots and harvesters that crawl the Web for email addresses to include on spam lists. Munging is where the e-mail address is not fully written out but is still understandable to anyone reading the Web page. The characters to the left of the @ symbol in your e-mail address should not be altered when munging.
For example, munging the fakeaddress@webopedia.com could result in something like fakeaddress-AT-webopedia-DOT-com.
The term munge is frequently defined as "mash until no good" and is also called address munging.

municipal_Wi_Fi
Often abbreviated as muni Wi-Fi, municipal Wi-Fi is a city-wide (municipal) wireless network, based mainly on 802.11 networking standards that provide high-speed Internet access within the municipality for free or low cost access when compared to standard broadband access fees. Municipal Wi-Fi networks are a type of wireless mesh network.

MUSH
Short for Multi-User Shared Hallucination, a text-based MUD system. There are many MUSH worlds that have been evolving for years. 

must_carry
In digital television the term must-carry is used to describe the legal obligation of a cable company (the carrier) to carry analog or digital signal broadcasts.

mutex
(1) Short for mutual exclusion object. In computer programming, a mutex is a program object that allows multiple program threads to share the same resource, such as file access, but not simultaneously. When a program is started, a mutex is created with a unique name. After this stage, any thread that needs the resource must lock the mutex from other threads while it is using the resource. The mutex is set to unlock when the data is no longer needed or the routine is finished.  (2) When spelled MuTeX, a package of macros for the TeX typesetting system that supports musical notation. MuTeX was written by Andrea Steinbach and Angelika Schofer, as a master's thesis at Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms University.

MVNE
Short for Mobile Virtual Network Enabler, MVNEs provides both an infrastructure and related services to MVNOs. This includes network provisioning, administration and various operations such as billing and account handling. A MVNE does not have a direct relationship with the end-user (customer), but rather they provide the services directly to the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO).

MVNO
(pronounced as separate letters) Short for mobile virtual network operator, a mobile service operator that does not have its own licensed spectrum and does not have the infrastructure to provide mobile service to its customers (i.e., it does not own the network on which its voice and data traffic is carried). Instead, MVNOs lease wireless capacity from pre-existing mobile service providers and establish their own brand names different from the providers. For example, Virgin MobileUSA (the first American MVNO) uses Sprint as its underlying carrier, Page Plus uses Verizon, EZ Link Plus uses Cingular, and Air Voice Wireless uses AT&T.  MVNOs typically offer subscription-based voice and data service, and the customers are not doing business with underlying wireless provider but with the MVNO brand.

MVS
Short for Multiple Virtual Storage, the operating system for older IBM mainframes. MVS was first introduced in 1974 and continues to be used, though it has been largely superseded by IBM's newer operating system, OS/390. IBM's mainframe operating system is now called z/OS.

mWare
Short for mobileware, mWare is a term used to describe computer software that is designed to run on mobile devices.

MX_record
Short for mail exchange record, an entry in a domain name database that identifies the mail server that is responsible for handling e-mails for that domain name.  When more than one MX record is entered for any single domain name that is using more than one mail server, the MX record can be prioritized with a preference number that indicates the order in which the mail servers should be used. This enables the use of primary and backup mail servers.

Mylar
Mylar is an extraordinarily strong polyester film that was developed in the early 1950s. During the 1960s cellophane gave way steadily to Mylar with its superior strength, heat resistance, and excellent insulating properties. The unique qualities of Mylar made new consumer markets in magnetic audio and video tape, capacitor dielectrics, packaging and batteries possible. By the 1970s, Mylar had become DuPont's best-selling film. Mylar is now a product of a joint venture, DuPont Teijin Films.

MySpace
The name of a social networking site (SNS) that consists of a network of member's profiles, Web logs, photos, e-mail, forums, group, and more. MySpace was founded in August 2003 by the Internet company eUniverse. In 2006 News Corp. bought Intermix Media, parent company of MySpace for $580 million.

MySQL
Pronounced "my ess cue el" (each letter separately) and not "my SEE kwill." MySQL is an open source RDBMS that relies on SQL for processing the data in the database. MySQL provides APIs for the languages C, C++, Eiffel, Java, Perl, PHP and Python. In addition, OLE DB and ODBC providers exist for MySQL data connection in the Microsoft environment. A MySQL .NET Native Provider is also available, which allows native MySQL to .NET access without the need for OLE DB.  MySQL is most commonly used for Web applications and for embedded applications and has become a popular alternative to proprietary database systems because of its speed and reliability. MySQL can run on UNIX, Windows and Mac OS.  MySQL is developed, supported and marketed by MySQL AB. The database is available for free under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) or for a fee to those who do not wish to be bound by the terms of the GPL.

Windows_Server
A series of server operating systems developed by Microsoft Corporation. Windows servers are more powerful versions of their desktop operating system counterparts and are designed to more efficiently handle corporate networking, Internet/intranet hosting, databases, enterprise-scale messaging and similar functions.
The Windows Server name made its debut with the release of Windows Server 2003 and continues with the current release, Windows Server 2008 R2, which shares its codebase with Windows 7. Windows Server 2008 R2 debuted in October 2009 and currently has its first service pack (SP1) in development.
