I_beam_pointer
)A pointer shaped like a capital I used in graphics-based text processing applications. Many desktop publishing systems and word processors use an I-beam pointer to mark blocks of text and move the insertion point. Note that the I-beam pointer is not the same as the selection pointer, which is usually shaped like an arrow.  

I_frame
Short for intraframe, a video compression method used by the MPEG standard. In a motion sequence, individual frames of pictures are grouped together (called a group of pictures, or GOP) and played back so that the viewer registers the video��s spatial motion. Also called a keyframe, an I-frame is a single frame of digital content that the compressor examines independent of the frames that precede and follow it and stores all of the data needed to display that frame. Typically, a I-frames are interspersed with P-frames and B-frames in a compressed video. The more I-frames that are contained, the better quality the video will be; however, I-frames contain the most amount of bits and therefore take up more space on the storage medium.  Also see P-frame and B-frame.

i_mode
See DoCoMo.

i_LINK
The name given to the Sony Corp. implementation of the IEEE 1394 standard. It's the 4-pin or 6-pin bi-directional digital cable link between your Sony camcorder products and devices such as your PC or digital television, for example. i.LINK is also called FireWire or IEE 1394.See also IEEE 1394. 

I_O
Short for input/output (pronounced "eye-oh"). The term I/O is used to describe any program, operation or device that transfers data to or from a computer and to or from a peripheral device. Every transfer is an output from one device and an input into another. Devices such as keyboards and mouses are input-only devices while devices such as printers are output-only. A writable CD-ROM is both an input and an output device.

I_O_adapter
An adapter that converts between the timing and protocol requirements of an intelligent device's memory bus and those of an I/O bus or network.

I_O_throttling
Short for input/output throttling, a technique used to more efficiently handle memory processing. During low-memory conditions, a system will slow down the processing of I/O memory requests, typically processing one sequence at a time in the order the request was received. I/O throttling slows down a system but typically will prevent the system from crashing.

I2C
Short for Inter-IC, a type of bus designed by Philips Semiconductors in the early 1980s, which is used to connect integrated circuits (ICs). I2C is a multi-master bus, which means that multiple chips can be connected to the same bus and each one can act as a master by initiating a data transfer. I2C is used in many devices, especially video devices such as computer monitors, televisions and VCRs. 

I2O
Also called Intelligent I/O, a new I/O architecture being developed by a consortium of computer companies called the I2O special Interest Group (SIG). I2O is designed to eliminate I/O bottlenecks by utilizing special I/O processors (IOPs) that handle the nitty gritty details of interrupt handling, buffering and data transfer. In addition, an I2O driver consists of an OS-specific module (OSM) that deals with higher-level operating system details (such as accessing files) and a hardware device module (HDM), that understands how to communicate with specific devices. Because the OSM and HDM are autonomous, they can perform a number of tasks independently, without sending data over the I/O bus.  I2O is being designed to work with PCI but isn't expect to be widely available until 1998 or later. 

IA
Short for interconnection agreement, a contract between a requesting carrier or CLEC and an ILEC for UNEs, collocation, resale, access to poles, conduits and right of way, physical interconnection and compensation for the exchange of traffic between the two networks.  Section 252 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 sets out the methods to secure an IA and a few of the substantive requirements. Section 251 provides additional substantive guidance. In addition, Part 51 of the FCC's rules further flesh out the statutory requirements for substance and process.

IaaS
Short for Infrastructure as a Service, IaaS is defined as computer infrastructure, such as virtualization, being delivered as a service. IaaS is popular in the data center where software and servers are purchased as a fully outsourced service and usually billed on usage and how much of the resource is used - compared to the traditional method of buying software and servers outright. May also be called enterprise-level hosting platform. Sun Microsystems identifies Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) as one of three layers of cloud computing, in addition to Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS).

IAC
Short for Internet Access Coalition, a consortium of companies involved in the Internet, including AT&T, Microsoft, and MCI. The IAC's stated purpose is to maintain the affordability of Internet access over telephone lines and accelerate the availability of inexpensive digital telephone network connections to the Internet. 

IAHC
Short for Internet International Ad Hoc Committee, the international organization responsible for managing the Internet's Domain Name System (DNS). The Committee was dissolved on May 1, 1997 

iam-identity-and-access-management
 An acronym for Identity and Access Management, IAM refers to a framework of policies and technologies for ensuring that the proper people in an enterprise have the appropriate access to technology resources.
Also called identity management (IdM), IAM systems fall under the overarching umbrella of IT security. Identity and access management systems not only identify, authenticate and authorize individuals who will be utilizing IT resources, but also the hardware and applications employees need to access.
Identity and Access Management solutions have become more prevalent and critical in recent years as regulatory compliance requirements have become increasingly more rigorous and complex.

IANA
Short for Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, an organization working under the auspices of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) that is responsible for assigning new Internet-wide IP addresses. 

IAP
Short for Internet Access Provider, a company that provides access to the Internet. IAPs generally provide dial-up access through a modem and PPP connection, though companies that offer Internet access with other devices, such as cable modemsor wireless connections, could also be considered IAPs.
The terms IAPs and ISP (Internet Service Providers) are often used interchangeably, though some people consider IAPs to be a subset of ISPs. Whereas IAPs offer only Internet access, ISPs may provide additional services, such as leased lines (T-1 or T-3) and Web development. In contrast to both IAPs and ISPs, online servicesprovide their own proprietary content in addition to Internet access.


IAX
Short for Inter-Asterisk eXchange, IAX is the native Asterisk PBX protocol and is now supported by many VoIP platforms. It has a number of advantages over SIP including bandwidth efficiency, it uses a single UDP port, 4569, so it slides through  NAT with ease, and since it is a binary protocol, it is more difficult to attack. Despite these advantages IAX is not supported as widely as SIP, and it also puts a heavier load on your server because all traffic must pass through the server. See Asterisk. See also "VoIPowering Your Office: Defeat the Pesky NATs of VoIP With IAX" on VoIPPlanet.com.

ibeacon
iBeacons are Apple's implementation of small, often inexpensive beacon devices that utilize Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) wireless signals to deliver location-based product information and offers or specials to iOS-powered mobile devices like iPhones and iPads.
Apple added iBeacon functionality in the iOS 7 update, and the company also released a software development kit (SDK) at that time to enable enterprises and developers to utilize the functionality in their own apps.
Because iBeacons rely on iOS 7 and later updates, iBeacon technology will only work with the iPhone 4S and later versions, third-generation or later iPads, iPad Minis, and fifth-generation or later iPod Touch devices.

iBGP
Short for Internal BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), iBGP is the protocol used between the routers in the same autonomous system (AS). IBGP is used to provide information to your internal routers.   See also BGP.

IBM
Short for International Business Machines, the largest computer company in the world. IBM started in 1911 as a producer of punch card tabulating machines. In 1953, it introduced its first computer, the 701. During the 60's and 70's, IBM came to dominate the new field of mainframe and minicomputers. In 1981, IBM launched its first personal computer,  called the IBM PC, which quickly became the standard. However, IBM underestimated the market for PCs and lost market share to vendors of PC compatibles, such as Compaq.


ibm_cast_iron
Short for IBM WebSphere Cast Iron Cloud Integration, IBM Cast Iron is an offering from IBM that provides clients with a platform for integrating cloud-based applications from leading SaaS providers with on-premise applications from IBM and other companies.

IBM_PC
Refers to a family of personal computers produced by IBM. The term can also refer to computers that conform to set of loosely controlled standards. These are also called IBM clones , IBM compatibles , or simply compatibles. These terms are actually misnomers because many of the PCs produced by IBM do not conform to industry standards. For example, IBM attempted to change the expansion bus to MCA in its PS/2 line of PCs, but the industry did not follow suit.  

ibm_puredata_system_for_hadoop
IBM PureData System for Hadoop is part of the IBM PureSystems family of solutions (including IBM PureApplication System, IBM PureFlex System and PureData System) and is designed to help organizations embrace big data, cloud computingand mobile computing.

IBSS
An 802.11 networking framework in which devices or stations communicate directly with each other, without the use of an access point (AP). Ad-hoc mode is also referred to as peer-to-peer mode or an Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS). Ad-hoc mode is useful for establishing a network where wireless infrastructure does not exist or where services are not required.

ICA
Short for Independent Computing Architecture, ICA is a protocol designed specifically for transmitting Windows graphical display data as well as keyboard and mouse input over a network. ICA is one of two technologies used by Citrix servers, the other being WinFrame. See Citrix server. See also WinFrame.

ICANN
Short for Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, a nonprofit organization that has assumed the responsibility for IP address space allocation, protocol parameter assignment, domain name system management and root server systemmanagement functions previously performed under U.S. Government contract.
ICANN was created by the late Jon Postel in the fall of 1998 in response to a policy statement issued by the US Department of Commerce. This statement called for the formation of a private sector not-for-profit Internet stakeholder to administer policy for the Internet name and address system.
Thus far ICANN has taken various measures to oversee the domain-name registration system's transition from government hands to private hands and to coordinate its decentralization and the integration into a global community.

ICAP
ICAP, the Internet Content Adaption Protocol, is a protocol aimed at providing simple object-based content vectoring for HTTP services.
ICAP is, in essence, a lightweight protocol for executing a "remote procedure call" on HTTP messages. It allows ICAP clients to pass HTTP messages to ICAP servers for some sort of transformation or other processing ("adaptation"). The server executes its transformation service on messages and sends back responses to the client, usually with modified messages. Typically, the adapted messages are either HTTP requests or HTTP responses. [Source ICAP Official Website]

ICE
(1) Short for Information and Content Exchange.   (2) Short for in-circuit emulator. (3) Short for Incase of Emergency, in mobile phone terminology ICE refers to a concept conceived by Cambridge paramedic Bob Brotchie, and it refers to using the acronym ICE in front of your designated emergency contact in your cell phone address book. It is also recommended that if your ICE contact is deaf, the acronym ICETEXT should be used to identify your ICE contact in your cellphone contact list.  See also "The Difference Between a Cell Phone, Smartphone and PDA" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia.

ice_cream_sandwich
Ice Cream Sandwich is the dessert-themed Android codename for version 4.0 of the open source Android mobile operating system. Ice Cream made its debut in October 2011 as Google’s “everywhere” operating system for smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices.
With Ice Cream Sandwich Google worked to unify the v2.x/v3.x forks of Android development while also adapting the Android framework and adding new APIs to help put an end to the issue of Android fragmentation. Ice Cream Sandwich also brought many of the tablet-centric features in Honeycomb (Android v3.0) to smartphones, including video chat support based on Google Talk protocols, a new System Bar for global status and notifications and an Action Bar for application control, tabbed Web browsing support, an optimized soft keyboard and a new email interface.
Ice Cream follows a number of earlier updates for Android, including Cupcake (v1.5), Donut (v1.6), Eclair (v2.0), FroYo (v2.2), Gingerbread  (v2.3) and Honeycomb (v3.0). The successor to Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean (v5.0) is expected to become available in late 2012.

ICF
Short for Internet Connection Firewall, a feature of the Windows XP operating system. The ICF is a firewall that protects a home or small business network that is connected to the Internet via a cable, DSL or dial-up modem. Devices that are connected to the Internet via a software or hardware router cannot use ICF.  Windows XP keeps a log of any information a user requests from the Internet -- for example, when the user requests a Web page or accesses an e-mail account. When information enters a computer, ICF checks the log to determine if it is something the user has requested. If ICF does not recognize the request, it drops the transmission and records the activity in a separate log that the user can check to see if any security issues need to be addressed.  ICF only blocks undesirable Internet traffic from coming into a network; it does not prevent outgoing traffic from being subjected to malicious hacker attacks such as Trojan horses or spyware programs.  ICF should not be used in virtual private networks because it will interfere with file sharing and print spooling.

ICH
)
Short for I/O Controller Hub, ICH is an implementation of the Accelerated Hub Architecture (ACHA), often referred to as the Southbridge, a reference to the older, three-tier chipset design. It is the slower end of the ACHA, and most I/O devices are connected to the hub through it.

Abbreviated as ICM, information classification and management is a class of application-independent software that use advanced indexing, classification, policy and data access capabilities to automate data management activities above the storage layer.

ICMP
Short for Internet Control Message Protocol, an extension to the Internet Protocol (IP) defined by RFC 792. ICMP supports packets containing error, control, and informational messages. The PING command, for example, uses ICMP to test an Internet connection.


icon
A small picture that represents an object or program. Icons are very useful in applications that use windows, because with the click of a mouse button you can shrink an entire window into a small icon. (This is sometimes called minimizing.) To redisplay the window, you merely move the pointer to the icon and click (or double click) a mouse button. (This is sometimes called restoring or maximizing)
Icons are a principal feature of graphical user interfaces.


ICPP
Short for Intel Channel Partner Program, ICPP is a program that provides benefits and support to registered members selling Intel products, or solutions based on Intel products. The ICPP provides its members with resources and support to help build, promote, sell, and service Intel technologies. See also channel partners.

ICQ
An easy-to-use online instant messaging program developed by Mirabilis LTD. Prounounced as separate letters, so that it sounds like "I-Seek-You," ICQ is similar to America OnLine's popular Buddy List and Instant Messenger programs. It is used as a conferencing tool by individuals on the Net to chat, e-mail, perform file transfers, play computer games, and more.  Once you have downloaded and installed ICQ onto your PC, you can create a list of friends, family, business associates, etc. (who also have ICQ on their PC's). ICQ uses this list to find your friends for you, and notifies you once they have signed onto the Net. You can then send messages, chat in real time, play games, etc. 

ICR
Acronym for Intelligent Character Recognition. ICR is the computer translation of hand printed and written characters. Data is entered from hand-printed forms through a scanner, and the image of the captured data is then analyzed and translated by sophisticated ICR software. ICR is similar to optical character recognition (OCR) but is a more difficult process since OCR is from printed text, as opposed to handwritten characters. The biggest drawback of using ICR for data capture is the level of accuracy achieved, due to the changeable quality of handwriting on the forms and documents being processed. It can be difficult for ICR systems to accurately convert handwriting into text, particularly where names are being interpreted. There are many ICR systems on the market today, ranging from simple desktop solutions that sell for a few hundred dollars to sophisticated, high-volume systems that cost tens of thousands of dollars.

ICS
Short for Internet connection sharing, a method for connecting multiple computers in a LAN to the Internet through a single connection and a single IP address. ICS typically uses NAT technologies to achieve this and works with most connection technologies, including DSL, cable, ISDN, dial-up and satellite. The device with the modem or broadband interface that establishes the connection to the Internet is called the ICS host, or gateway while the other devices that connect to the Internet via the network and the ICS host are called ICS clients. If the ICS host fails, then all of the ICS clients lose their Internet connection.  Sharing an Internet connection can be achieved through either software or hardware solutions. All versions of Windows from Windows 98 and on have ICS software included in the operating system. However, there are also products such as WinGate and WinProxy, which are third-party shareware alternatives that will turn a computer into a gateway or proxy server. Hardware solutions involve a NAT-based hardware router that is connected directly to the Internet connection adapter, and each ICS client is then connected to the router.  Also referred to as simply Internet sharing, on Linux systems, this is called IP masquerading.

ICT
Short for Information and Communications Technology, it is the study or business of developing and using technology to process information and aid communications.

id10t_error
(pronounced eye-dee-ten-tee) Technical support shorthand used to describe a common computer error caused by a user who has "no idea about what they are doing". An id10t error is one that the user usually will not admit responsibility for. For example, if a user calls tech support claiming their password will not work, but they in fact were mistyping the password, the tech support may note the caller's file or log the event as an id10t error.

idaas-identity-as-a-service
IDaaS is an acronym for Identity-as-a-Service, and it refers to identity and access management services that are offered through the cloud or SaaS (software-as-a-service) on a subscription basis.
This is in contrast to traditional identify and access management (IAM) solutions that are typically completely on-premises and delivered via bundled software and/or hardware means. These systems also tend to rely heavily on Active Directory (AD) and the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for their IAM services.
Hybrid IAM Solutions and Pure IDaaS Services
Bridging the gap between traditional IAM software and native IDaaS options are hybrid IAM solutions from vendors like Microsoft and Amazon that provide cloud-based directories which link with on-premises IAM systems.

IDE

(n.) In a biometric security system, the process of comparing a biometric data sample against all of the system��s databased reference templates in order to establish the identity of the person trying to gain access to the system.  Contrast with verification.

identifier
Same as name. The term identifier is usually used for variable names.  

identity
In computer technology, the unique name of a person, device, or the combination of both that is recognized by a system. Many types of AAA systems rely on unique identities to ensure the security of networks and resources.

identity-management
Enterprise identity management (IdM), or ID management, is the part of identity and access management systems (IAM) responsible for identifying, authenticating and authorizing employees and their use of corporate information technology (IT) resources.
The second part of IAM, access management, works in conjunction with identity management to ensure employees have access to the specific hardware and applications they are authorized to use for their jobs. Access management can also enforce time and location policies for IT resources to help secure mission-
How IdM Works in Corporate Environments
Identity management systems enable IT administrations to define and change an individual's role as well as track their login details and IT activity. Admins can also enforce ID management policies based on user roles and resource usage. Another key part of modern identity management systems is to support Governance, Risk and Compliance with regard to increasingly stringent regulatory requirements.

IDF
Short for intermediate distribution frame, a cable rack that interconnects and manages the telecommunications wiring between an MDF and workstation devices. Cables entering a building run through a centralized MDF, then each individual IDF and then on to specific workstations. For example, an enterprise that encompasses a building with several floors may have one MDF on the first floor and one IDF on each of the floors that is connected to the MDF.

iDisk
iDisk is a service offered by Apple, which is touted as a personal hard disk on the Internet. iDisk allows Mac users to store files on Apple's servers and access them online from any Internet-connected computer (Mac or Windows). A Mac account comes with 250 MB of combined iDisk and Mac Mail storage and 3 GB of data transfer per month. Mac Mail is available to users for a free 60 day trail, after which it is a paid subscription service.

IDL
Short for Interface Definition Language or, alternatively, Interface Definition Language, a computer language or syntax used to describe object interfaces by their names, methods, parameters, events, and return types. A compiler uses the IDL information to generate code to pass data between machines.

IDN
Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) are domain names or Web addresses, represented by local language characters. When a user types an IDN in local language characters, an IDN resolution process is required to locate the corresponding Web site or e-mail address. The native language domain name will be followed by .com or .net. The goal of Internationalized Domain Names is to improve the international accessibility and functionality of the Internet by allowing users to register domain names in non-English languages.

IDNX
Short for Integrated Digital Network Exchange, a technology that multiplexes voice, data, and video onto multiple T1/E1 backbones. Allowing integration of equipment from different vendors, IDNX is an integrated packet/circuit switch providing frame-relay adaption for X.25 packet switches, SNA communications processors and other HDLC-based devices. IDNX concentrates and routes this traffic along with Ethernet and token-ring LAN-generated frame-relay frames, over private or public frame-relay networks. IDNX also supports voice/fax compression, ISDN and switched 56K/64K call setup, and digital cross-connection.  The IDNX family has been functionally superseded by the Promina family of ATM switching platforms, and in particular the Promina 800 Series Multiservice Access Platform that provides an enhanced chassis and bus system to the IDNX while being able to make use of IDNX modules.

IDSL
Short for ISDN Digital Subscriber Line, a method of providing DSL technology over existing ISDN lines. Even though the transfer rates for IDSL are about the same as ISDN (144kbps v. 128kbps), and IDSL circuits typically only carry data (not voice), the major benefits of switching to IDSL from ISDN are always-on connections, thus eliminating call setup delays; flat rate billing, instead of per minute fees; and transmission of data over the data network, rather than the PSTN.   IDSL was developed by Ascend Communications, now part of Lucent Technologies. 

iDVD
A software application from Apple Computer that provides users with a way to author desktop movies and still images, then write the project to a recordable DVD disc. DVD discs created with iDVD on an Apple DVD-R drive are compatible with most standard set-top and computer-based DVD players.

IEEE
Abbreviation of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, pronounced I-triple-E. Founded in 1884 as the AIEE, the IEEE was formed in 1963 when AIEE merged with IRE. IEEE is an organization composed of engineers, scientists, and students. The IEEE is best known for developing standards for the computer and electronics industry. In particular, the IEEE 802 standards for local-area networks are widely followed.


IEEE_1394
A very fast external bus standard that supports data transfer rates of up to 400Mbps (in 1394a) and 800Mbps (in 1394b). Products supporting the 1394 standard go under different names, depending on the company. Apple, which originally developed the technology, uses the trademarked name FireWire. Other companies use other names, such as i.link and Lynx,to describe their 1394 products.
A single 1394 port can be used to connect up 63 external devices. In addition to its high speed, 1394 also supports isochronous  data -- delivering data at a guaranteed rate. This makes it ideal for devices that need to transfer high levels of data in real-time, such as video devices.
Although extremely fast and flexible, 1394 is also expensive. Like USB, 1394 supports both Plug-and-Play and hot plugging, and also provides power to peripheral devices.

IEEE_802_standards
A set of network standards developed by the IEEE. They include:

IEEE 802.1: Standards related to network management.
IEEE 802.2: General standard for the data link layer in the OSI Reference Model. The IEEE divides this layer into two sublayers -- the logical link control (LLC) layer  and the media access control (MAC) layer.The MAC layer varies for different network types and is defined by standards IEEE 802.3 through IEEE 802.5.
IEEE 802.3: Defines the MAC layer for bus networks that use CSMA/CD. This is the basis of the Ethernet standard. Also see the Ethernet Designations chart in the Quick Referencesection of Webopedia.

IEEE 802.5: Defines the MAC layer for token-ring networks.
IEEE 802.6: Standard for Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).



IEEE_829
(pronounced as separate letters) An IEEE standard for documenting the testing of software. The standard typically applies to any stage in the testing of developing software, and each stage in the software's development typically is documented using the same application of the standard. The IEEE specifies eight stages in the documentation process, each stage producing its own separate document.

Test Plan: A detail of how the test will proceed, who will do the testing, what will be tested, in how much time the test will take place, and to what quality level the test will be performed.

IEEE 829 also is referred to as the 829 Standard for Software Test Documentation.

IEN
Short for Internet Experiment Notes, a series of documents similar to RFCs concerning the early experimental work in TCP and IP. In 1977, ARPA began organizing and financing a research project to build an Internet based on the work done by Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf in 1974. Led by the Internet Working Group, the project needed a way to share technical notes and created IENs so that they wouldn��t be confused with ARPANET��s RFCs.

IETF
Short for Internet Engineering Task Force, the main standards organization for the Internet. The IETF is a large open international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers concerned with the evolution of the Internet architecture and the smooth operation of the Internet. It is open to any interested individual.  

IFC
Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs) are data elements that represent the parts of buildings, or elements of the process, and contain the relevant information about those parts. IFCs are used by computer applications to assemble a computer readable model of the facility that contains all the information of the parts and their relationships to be shared among project participants. The project model constitutes an object-oriented database of the information shared among project participants and continues to grow as the project goes through design, construction and operation.  [Source: International Alliance for Interoperability]

iFCP
Short for the Internet Fibre Channel Protocol, iFCP allows an organization to extend Fibre Channel storage networks over the Internet by using TCP/IP. TCP is responsible for managing congestion control as well as error detection and recovery services. iFCP allows an organization to create an IP SAN fabric that minimizes the Fibre Channel fabric component and maximizes use of the company's TCP/IP infrastructure.

IFMS
Integrated Facilities Management Systems (IFMS) is an IT based fiscal and financial management information system (budgeting and accounting system) that will assist government and other entities to initiate, spend and monitor their budgets, initiate and process their payments, and manage and report on their financial activities. It bundles the essential financial management functions into one suite of applications.

IGES
Acronym for Initial Graphics Exchange Specification, an ANSI graphics file format for three-dimensional wire frame models.  

IGMP
Internet Group Management Protocol is defined in RFC 1112 as the standard for IP multicasting in the Internet.   It's used to establish host memberships in particular multicast groups on a single network. The mechanisms of the protocol allow a host to inform its local router, using Host Membership Reports, that it wants to receive messages addressed to a specific multicast group.   All hosts conforming to level 2 of the IP multicasting specification require IGMP. 

IGP
Short for interior gateway protocol, IGP is a generic term for a routing protocol that is used to exchange routing information among routers in an autonomous network, such as an enterprise LAN. IGPs typically support confined geographical areas. RIP and OSPF are two examples of an IGP.
Compare with EGP.

IHS
Short for Internal Hostile Structured, it is a threat defined by Symantec Corporation to mean an individual or group within an organization that is motivated to disrupt mission operations or exploit assets. An IHS threat is unlikely to act but has the greatest potential to cause damage. An example of an IHS threat might be a highly skilled, disgruntled employee who could benefit from disrupting operations.Contrast with IHU (Internal Hostile Unstructured).

iHTML
Short for inline HTML, an advanced server-side scripting/programming language that functions as an extension to HTML, allowing the customization of dynamic Web sites that depend on interaction with databases. iHTML eliminates the need for Javascript or CGI programs as it provides the same functionality.

IHU
Short for Internal Hostile Unstructured, it is a threat defined by Symantec Corporation to mean an individual within an organization who has physical access to network components. An IHU threat might lack the skills to launch a sophisticated attack, and instead might deploy common viruses. Contrast with IHS (InternalHostile Structured).

IHV
(pronounced as separate letters) Short for Independent hardware vendor, a hardware-manufacturing company that specializes in a specific type of hardware device and not a complete computer system. The IHV typically also provides the software drivers for its hardware devices.  Contrast with OEM.

IIM

Key attributes that define an IIM solution include the following:   Automated patching  Infrastructure database  Integrated IP device discovery  Alarms and events  Integration with third party applications  Data sharing   [Adapted from  BCS, Business IT Interface]

IIOP
Short for Internet Inter-ORB Protocol, a protocol developed by the Object Management Group (OMG) to implement CORBA solutions over the World Wide Web. IIOP enables browsers and servers to exchange integers, arrays, and more complex objects, unlike HTTP, which only supports transmission of text.    

IIS
Short for Internet Information Server, Microsoft's Web server that runs on Windows NT platforms. In fact, IIS comes bundled with Windows NT 4.0. Because IIS is tightly integrated with the operating system, it is relatively easy to administer. However, currently IIS is available only for the Windows NT platform, whereas Netscape's Web servers run on all major platforms, including Windows NT, OS/2 and UNIX.


iJack
(1) The term used to describe the theft of laptop computers when the perpetrator literally grabs the laptop out of the owner's hand and runs away with it.  (2) The theft of personal information to assume an identity and commit fraud. As defined by Intersections Inc., iJacking is an emotionally devastating crime that drains your accounts, hurts your reputation and leaves you financially paralyzed when thieves assume your identity or use your Social Security number to commit fraud crimes.

iKP
Short for Internet Keyed Payment, iKP is a set of protocols proposed by IBM Research in Hawthorne and Zurich, for electronic payments over open networks. iKP technology is based on RSA public-key cryptography and provides the architecture for credit card transactions between the customer and the merchant, while using the existing financial network for approval and clearing.

ILEC
Short for incumbent local exchange carrier. An ILEC is a telephone company that was providing local service when the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was enacted. Compare with CLEC, a company that competes with the already established local telephone business. 

identity-lifecycle-management
Identity Lifecycle Management, or ILM, is a buzz phrase associated with Identity Management (IdM) and Identity and Access Management (IAM) that refers to a collection of technologies and business processes utilized in creating, managing, coordinating and restricting the identification, access and governance of identities for access to business tools and information.
Also known as Identity Life Cycle Management, ILM encompasses the entire span of an employee's need to access critical business data, apps and tools in order to effectively perform their tasks and accomplish business objectives. It entails ensuring employees have access at various times and locations while logging, monitoring and restricting access when necessary to increase security and protect the enterprise's mission-critical data.
Identity Lifecycle Management also addresses the need for deprovisioning, or removing, access when an employee leaves the company or changes roles within the company.

ILM
Short for information lifecycle management, ILM is the creation and management of a storage infrastructure and the data that it maintains. All information, or data, in a storage network has a specific lifecycle, from the time the information enters an organization's system to the time it is archived or removed from the system.
The information may have a finite lifecycle where the data are eventually removed from a storage network when the information becomes outdated or no longer needed-or an infinite lifecycle if the information remains valuable to the organization retaining it.
The Three Stages in the Information Lifecycle
In general, there are three stages in the information lifecycle:

iLO
Short for integrated Lights-out, it's an intelligent remote management processor integrated in many HP ProLiant servers that provides IT professions with virtual presence — you get complete control of the server from remote sites akin to being local and using the server directly. iLO features include simplified setup, group configuration, remote power on/off, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) security, detailed server status, virtual indicators and diagnostics.

IM
IM is short for instant message, a type of communications service that enables you to create a kind of private chat room with another individual in order to communicate in real time over the Internet, analagous to a telephone conversation but using text-based, not voice-based, communication.
Typically, the instant messaging system alerts you whenever somebody on your private list is online. You can then initiate a chat session with that particular individual.
IM Software
Typically an Instant Messenger program is installed on your local computer. You create an account then add other people using the same IM program to your contact list (also called a friend or buddy list).  The program will alert you when a contact is online and you can initiate a chat session with that person. Most programs allow you to send instant messages back and forth with people in your contact list, create chat rooms for multiple contacts to communicate, share Web or video links, play sounds or connect with your friends using voice chat.

IM_worm
(ī-em wërm) (n.) A worm (i.e., a self-replicating program typically designed to perform harm to a computer or network) that propagates over instant messaging applications. The worm spreads by accessing the user's instant messaging address book, or buddy list, and sends itself to individual recipients from that list.  Like a worm that spreads over the Internet, an IM worm can crash a system or allow a malicious hacker to gain access to a user's device. Unlike the traditional form of a worm, an IM worm does not have to scan the Internet looking for vulnerbale IP addresses as it spreads by taking names from user address books and identifying who is currently online and therefore vulnerable.

IMA
Short for inverse multiplexing over ATM. IMA is a physical layer technology in which a high-speed stream of ATM cells is broken up and transmitted across multiple T1/E1 links, then is reconstructed back into the original ATM cell order at the destination. For companies with low to mid-range WAN requirements, the purchase of costly T3/E3 access is not a viable solution. IMA divides an aggregate stream of ATM cells across multiple T1/E1 WAN links on a cell-by-cell basis, mimicking the behavior of transmissions across T3/E3 lines.   IMA is a User-to-Network Interface standard approved by the ATM Forum in 1997. 

iMac
An Apple computer intended for home, school, and small offices, and promoted by Apple as an easy-to-use, stylish computer that outperforms other low-cost options. The computer comes equipped with a 500, 600 or 700MHz G3 processor, 32 MB SDRAM, 4GB hard disk drive, a 56K modem, and a Universal Serial Bus (USB ), which allows a user to add devices without restarting the computer. The iMac does not come with a floppy disk drive, which has raised concerns with some critics and users. Easily recognizable for its translucent colored casing, the computer sold quickly after its introduction in August 1998.   

image
(1) In computer science an image is an exact replica of the contents of a storage device (a hard disk drive or  CD-ROM for example) stored on a second storage device. See also disk image. (2) The term image is also used in place of the term digital image, which is an optically formed duplicate or other reproduction of an object formed by a lens or mirror. See also graphics.

image_de_skew
The process of straightening an image that has been scanned or photographed crookedly  that is an image that is slanting too far in one direction, or one that is misaligned. This process is done in the post-production stage using graphics software. Also called deskew.\ See also "The Digital Camera Picture" in Webopedia's Quick Reference section.

image_dimensions
Image dimensions are the length and width of a digital image. It is usually measured in pixels, but some graphics programs allow you to view and work with your image in the equivalent inches or centimeters. Depending on what you plan to use your image for you may want to change the image size. For example, if you are using a high-resolution digital photograph, you may want to make the image dimensions smaller for publishing to a Web page. When using a graphics or image-editing program, you will usually have two options for changing the image dimensions: resize or resample.
See also "Graphics Software Terminology" in the  Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

image_editor
A graphics  program that provides a variety of special features for altering bit-mapped images. The difference between image editors and paint programs is not always clear-cut, but in general image editors are specialized for modifying bit-mapped images, such as scanned photographs, whereas paint programs are specialized for creating images.  In addition to offering a host of filters and image transformation algorithms, image editors also enable you to create and superimpose layers.  

image_effects
In graphics and image-editing programs, image effects are predefined algorithms that enable you to add special effects to your images. The actual effects will depend on the software you use. You can usually choose different effects that will change the edges of your image, noise level, gradient and other aspects of your image.   With most programs you can simply select the name of the image effect and the program will produce the image with the effect, then you can save the changed image. You can also choose undo if you don't like it and select another one to try. Also, you may find your program offers an effects browser, which will open your image as a thumbnail in a browser window that allows you to quickly preview how each effect will look before performing the action. Image effects are used as a way to change your image to add an artistic look, make textured patterns, or produce an enhanced real-world view. Some graphics programs will offer a few predefined effects, others designed with effects in mind may offer hundreds of image effects to choose from.  See also "Graphics Software Terminology" in the  Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

image_enhancement
In computer graphics, the process of improving the quality of a digitally stored image by manipulating the image with software. It is quite easy, for example, to make an image lighter or darker, or to increase or decrease contrast. Advanced image enhancement software also supports many filters for altering images in various ways. Programs specialized for image enhancement are sometimes called image editors.


image_map
A single graphic image containing more than one hot spot. For example, imagine a graphic of a bowl of fruit. When you click on a banana, the system displays the number of calories in a banana and when you click on an apple, it displays the number of calories in an apple.  Image maps are used extensively on the World Wide Web. Each hot spot in a Web image map takes you to a different Web page.  Image map is sometimes spelled as one word: imagemap.  

image_processing
Analyzing and manipulating images with a computer. Image processing generally involves three steps:  1. Import an image with an optical scanner or directly through digital photography. 2. Manipulate or analyze the image in some way. This stage can include image enhancement and data compression, or the image may be analyzed to find patterns that aren't visible by the human eye. For example, meteorologists use image processing to analyze satellite photographs. 3. Output the result. The result might be the image altered in some way or it might be a report based on analysis of the image.   

image_spam
A new way for cybercriminals to lure users into clicking obfuscated URLs. With image spam the obfuscated URL is hidden in an image rather than text making it more difficult to detect.  See also obfuscated URL.

imagesetter
A typesetting device that produces very high-resolution output on paper or film. Imagesetters are too expensive for homes or most offices, but you can obtain imagesetter output by bringing a PostScript file to a service bureau. One reason that PostScript has become the standard for desktop publishing is that nearly all imagesetters support it. This means that you can produce drafts on an inexpensive PostScript laser printer with high assurance that the final output from an imagesetter will look the same, but with higher resolution (up to 3,540 dots per inch).  

ImageWriter
(1) Refers to any in a family of dot-matrix printers that Apple offers for the Macintosh computer. Laser printers for the Macintosh are called LaserWriters. (2) A means of programming semiconductor devices after they are already mounted on a circuit board.  The programmer, designed by Data I/O Corporation, has device-specific algorithms for microcontroller or programmable memory devices, and these algorithms are used to serially write a binary image into the programmable array on the device, using serial interfaces such as SPI, I2C, or RS232.

IMAP
Short for Internet Message Access Protocol, a protocol for retrieving e-mail messages. The latest version, IMAP4, is similar to POP3 but supports some additional features. For example, with IMAP4, you can search through your e-mail messages for keywords while the messages are still on mail server. You can then choose which messages to download to your machine.
IMAP was developed at Stanford University in 1986.


IMEI
IMEI is short for International Mobile Equipment Identity and is a unique number given to every single mobile phone, typically found behind the battery.
IMEI numbers of cellular phones connected to a GSM network are stored in a database (EIR - Equipment Identity Register) containing all valid mobile phone equipment.
When a phone is reported stolen or is not type approved, the number is marked invalid.

imessage
iMessage is a free service from Apple that enables users of iOS-powered devices to send text messages over Wi-Fi from mobile devices like the iPhone and iPod touch. Prior to iMessage, most users needed to use a text message plan from a mobile provider in order to be able to send text messages from their iOS-powered device.
When sending text messages via iMessage, the mobile device's Messages app will first identify the recipient of the message prior to sending, and automatically send the messages via iMessage if the recipient's device uses iOS 5 (or later) or via the sender's regular text messaging service if the recipient doesn't have an iOS 5-powered device. 
Users can easily distinguish messages sent via iMessage, as message replies appear in a blue-shaded bubble as opposed to the Messages app’s standard green-colored bubble.  Users of iMessage-capable devices can send an unlimited number of messages for free via iMessage. In addition to sending text messages, iMessage also supports sending photos, videos, Web links, contacts and location information. iMessage can also be used to send group messages to multiple people. 

IMG
(1) In computer science an image is an exact replica of the contents of a storage device (a hard disk drive or  CD-ROM for example) stored on a second storage device. See also disk image. (2) The term image is also used in place of the term digital image, which is an optically formed duplicate or other reproduction of an object formed by a lens or mirror. See also graphics.

imgur
The name of a popular online image sharing website. Imgur is a free service to share photos with social networks and online communities. Users can upload images to a public directory or share a private URL to view the images with family and friends. The Imgur homepage offers images of today, sorted by popularity and posted images offer a discussion forum where comments can be left by other users. Users can "upvote" (give a  "thumbs up") favorite images and user comments.

immerce
Often referred to as simply ecommerce (or e-commerce) the phrase is used to describe business that is conducted over the Internet using any of the applications that rely on the Internet, such as e-mail, instant messaging, shopping carts, Web services, UDDI, FTP, and EDI, among others. Electronic commerce can be between two businesses transmitting funds, goods, services and/or data or between a business and a customer.

impact_printer
Impact printer refers to a class of printers that work by banging a head or needle against an ink ribbon to make a mark on the paper. This includes dot-matrix printers, daisy-wheel printers, and line printers. In contrast, laser and ink-jet printers are nonimpact printers.The distinction is important because impact printers tend to be considerably noisier than nonimpact printers but are useful for multipart forms such as invoices.


implementation_manager
An implementation manager is an IT project manager who focuses on implementing information systems into a business environment. The implementation manager oversees the task, ensuring the project adheres to budget and time frame guidelines. Steps in the implementation process include setting goals, planning, and monitoring progress to completion.
Recruit, Manage and Plan
Along the way, implementation managers may recruit and manage a team of IT workers, create a network planning diagram and timeline, develop and monitor a budget, and serve as a liaison between team members and external stakeholders such as senior management.
Requirements and Salary
Implementation managers draw on a combination of business and information technology expertise. In addition to the required bachelor's degree, implementation managers can hone their skills in a formal project management training course or MBA program. According to a 2006 survey by the Project Management Institute, implementation managers earn a median annual salary of $96,000, including bonuses.

import
To use data produced by another application. The ability to import data is very important in software applications because it means that one application can complement another. Many programs, for example, are designed to be able to import graphics in a variety of formats.  The opposite of importing is exporting, which refers to the ability of one application to format data for another application.  

impostor
(n.) In a biometric security system, a person who submits a biometric sample in an attempt (either intentional or unintentional) to gain access to a system using the identity of another enrollee.

impression
An advertisement's appearance on an accessed Web page. For example, if the page you're on shows three ads, that's three impressions. Advertisers use impressions to measure the number of views their ads receive, and publishers often sell ad space according to impressions. (It can be tough to know, though, whether an impression really means a visitor saw the ad, since they could be browsing without graphics or might not have scrolled down far enough.) Impressions are tracked in a log maintained by a site server and are often sold on a cost per thousand (CPM) basis.   

IMSI
Acronym for International Mobile Subscriber Identity, IMSI is a unique number that is associated with all GSM and UMTS network mobile phone users. An International Mobile Subscriber Identity is up to 15 digits long. The first three digits represent the country code, followed by the the network code. The remaining digits, up to fifteen represents the unique subscriber number from within the network's customer base.

IMT_2000_direct_spread

in-app_billing
In-app billing refers to in-app purchases that are made directly from within a mobile application on Google's Android platform. With in-app billing, Android users are able to purchase additional content or features such as bonus levels, virtual money, power-ups or boosts, special characters and more from within the app itself.
Google facilitates the purchase for users and takes a 30% cut of the money spent on the in-app billing purchase, with the rest going to the developer of the app. Google added in-app billing support in March 2011.

in-app_purchase
In-app purchases are purchases made from within a mobile application. Users typically make an in-app purchase in order to access special content or features in an app such as power-ups, restricted levels, virtual money, special characters, boosts, etc. The purchasing process is completed directly from within the app and is seamless to the user in most cases, with the mobile platform provider facilitating the purchase and taking a share of the money spent (usually in the range of 30% or so), with the rest going to the app developer.
In-app purchases first became available in Apple's App Store with the release of iOS 3.0 in October 2009. The BlackBerry App World added support for in-app purchases in September 2010, and in March 2011 Google added its version of in-app purchases called in-app billing for Android users.
Apple currently offers four different types of in-app purchases: non-replenishable, replenishable, subscription-based and auto-renewing subscriptions. In-app purchases can apply to premium apps as well as free apps, which are also known as freemium apps.

in_camera_red_eye_fix
In digital camera terminology, in-camera red-eye fix is a function of some digital camera software that will analyze each image and auto-correct any incidences red-eye, which can occur when photographing people or animals using the camera flash. If a digital camera does not have an in-camera red-eye fix, instances of red-eye can be fixed or reduced using a graphics program in post-production. May also be called digital red-eye correction. See "Digital Cameras" in the  Quick Reference section of Webopedia. See also "Graphics Software Terminology" in the  Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

in_memory_analytics
A platform into which you can install a portable computer. The docking station typically contains slots for expansion cards, bays for storage devices, and connectors for peripheral devices, such as printers and monitors. Once inserted in a docking station, the portable computer essentially becomes a desktop model computer. When it is taken out, it becomes a portable computer again. Most importantly, the same data is accessible in both modes because it resides on the portable computer's drives. The idea behind docking stations is to let you simultaneously enjoy the expansion possibilities of desktop model computers with the portability of notebook computers. In addition, the docking station enables you to use a full-size keyboard and monitor when you're not traveling. 

in-memory_database
A database that uses a system's main memory for data storage rather than the disk-based storage typically utilized by traditional databases. In-memory databases, or IMDBs, are frequently employed in high-volume environments where response time is critical, as access times and database requests are typically considerably faster when system memory is used as opposed to disk storage, particularly hard drive storage.
In-memory databases are also sometimes referred to as main memory database systems, or MMDBs, and have become more popular in recent years for handing High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Big Data applications. The distinction between traditional databases and in-memory databases has been blurred recently with the advent of hybrid databases, which support both in-memory and disk-based storage in order to maximize performance as well as reliability.

in_point
In video editing it is the start of a frame where you begin an edit. May also be called a mark in.Contrast with out-point

in_row_cooling
A technology common to data centers where a cooling system is installed between server racks in a row to provide cooled air to the server equipment more efficiently.

in-vehicle-infotainment-ivi
Integrated infotainment systems in automobiles that deliver entertainment and information content.  In-Vehicle Infotainment, or IVI, development has been spurred largely by Intel and its Atom processor, Microsoft and its Windows Embedded Automotive 7 platform, and a number of automobile manufacturers.
In-Vehicle Infotainment systems are currently available in select automobiles from manufacturers like Ford (SYNC and MyFord Touch), Toyota (Entune), Kia Motors (UVO), Cadillac (CUE) and Fiat (Blue&Me). IVI systems frequently utilize Bluetooth technology and/or smartphones to help drivers control the system with voice commands, touchscreen input, or physical controls.
While each IVI system is different, typical tasks that can be performed with an in-vehicle infotainment system include managing and playing audio content, utilizing navigation for driving, delivering rear-seat entertainment such as movies, games, social networking, etc., listening to incoming and sending outgoing SMS text messages, making phone calls, and accessing Internet-enabled or smartphone-enabled content such as traffic conditions, sports scores and weather forecasts.

inbound_call_center
A type of call center that is designed to receive a large volume of requests -- or inbound calls -- from customers by telephone. Inbound call centers typically handle telephone requests for product or technical support, account assistance, sales, subscription management, billing and other inquiries from consumers.

inbox_placement_rate
Abbreviated as IPR, in permission-based email marketing the inbox placement rate is a deliverability benchmark  that is used to determine what percentage of send emails reach the intended subscriber's inbox. In email marketing, there is a growing trend for marketers to focus on inbox placement rates as a key metric instead of determining deliverability based only on email bounce rates.

Incident_Management_Activities
In ITIL terminology, Incident Management Activities includes best practices for dealing with incident management, which is a set pattern of actions that can be taken to resolve the incident. Incident Management Activities include the following:   Incident detection and reporting  Classification and initial support  Investigation and diagnosis Resolution and recovery Incident closure  Incident ownership 

inclusive_OR_operator
A Boolean operator that returns a value of TRUE if either or both of its operands is TRUE. Contrast with the exclusive OR  operator, which returns a value of TRUE only if just one of the operands is True. 

incorporated_business
An incorporated business (also called a corporation) is a type of business that offers many benefits over being a sole proprietor or partnership, including liability protection and additional tax deductions. Forming a corporation also allows you raise capital through sale of shares of your company. According to Small Business Computing, there are three common corporate structure including:


C Corporation: the most common business entity. It is formed as a separate legal entity that's wholly controlled by company shareholders.
S Corporation: offers liability protection to shareholders, and shareholders enjoy certain tax breaks not offered under other business structures.
Limited Liability Corporation: LLCs benefit from side-stepping double taxation on corporate profits (members report profit or loss on their individual tax returns).

(v.)To create an index for a database, or to find records using an index.


indexed_color
In digital photography and imaging, indexed color is the term used to describe reduced color mapping of 8-bit or less. This is done to reduce images to their smallest size and these images are most commonly used on Web pages as they are small and quick to load. The 256 color palette is mapped for best results on the Internet, taking into account the differences between the Windows and Macintosh color palettes.  See "A Quick Guide to Digital Cameras" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia. See also Megapixel.net for news, reviews and a active community for digital camera and photography enthusiasts.

Indigo
(n.) Indigo, part of Microsoft's Windows operating system code-named Longhorn, unifies a variety of Microsoft technologies (COM+, MSMQ, ASP.NET Web services [ASMX], Remoting) and transports (HTTP, TCP, UDP, IPC) to create a single framework and runtime environment for building distributed systems.  Indigo is suited for building Service Oriented (SO) systems. Service Orientation helps architects and developers design and build connected systems. Service Orientation complements Object Orientation and helps express services in a platform and implementation independent manner.  Services are programs that are communicated with via message exchange. Services are autonomous, which means they exist and run on their own. Functionality exposed by these services are described using standards-based schema and contracts. Many applications can call a service, and the service won't crash if one of the consuming applications breaks. A system is a collection of deployed services cooperating in a given task. Systems are built to adapt to change.  Indigo is implemented in .NET; therefore, services are created with any CLR-compliant language. Indigo services are exposed on the wire via standards based technologies (such as XML, XSD, SOAP, WSDL, and other Web services specifications).  Indigo services are bound to the network through one or more channels attached to a port. Each channel is built dynamically at connection time to support the communications requirements negotiated between caller and service. This way, an Indigo service can talk to both a local Indigo service via IPC and a remote client app via HTTP at the same time.  Earlier .NET Framework distributed technologies such as ASP.NET Web services, Enterprise Services, .NET Remoting, COM+/MSMQ can be used from within Indigo applications. Indigo can also interoperate on the wire with ASP.NET Web services, Enterprise Services, COM+/MSMQ, and any applications built on infrastructure that conforms to Web services standards.  Microsoft will provide mechanisms for migrating applications that use most existing frameworks to services.  Microsoft asserts that Indigo will also be instrumental in facilitating true peer-to-peer communication, where PC users can "exchange data, share resources, locate other users, communicate, and collaborate directly in real time" without the need for Internet servers.

inductor
An electrical component that generates a magnetic field when a current is passed through it and stores the energy in the form of the magnetic field. An inductor typically is a loop or coil of wire.

Industry_Foundation_Classes
Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs) are data elements that represent the parts of buildings, or elements of the process, and contain the relevant information about those parts. IFCs are used by computer applications to assemble a computer readable model of the facility that contains all the information of the parts and their relationships to be shared among project participants. The project model constitutes an object-oriented database of the information shared among project participants and continues to grow as the project goes through design, construction and operation.  [Source: International Alliance for Interoperability]

InfiniBand
Both an I/O architecture and a specification for the transmission of data between processors and I/O devices that has been gradually replacing the PCI bus in high-end servers and PCs. Instead of sending data in parallel, which is what PCI does, InfiniBand sends data in serial and can carry multiple channels of data at the same time in a multiplexing signal. The principles of InfiniBand mirror those of mainframe computer systems that are inherently channel-based systems. InfiniBand channels are created by attaching host channel adapters (HCAs) and target channel adapters (TCAs) through InfiniBand switches. HCAs are I/O engines located within a server. TCAs enable remote storage and network connectivity into the InfiniBand interconnect infrastructure, called a fabric. InfiniBand architecure is capable of supporting tens of thousands of nodes in a single subnet.  InfiniBand is a trademarked term. The technology is a result of the merger of two competing designs -- Future I/O, which was developed by Compaq, IBM and Hewlett-Packard, and Next Generation I/O, which was developed by Intel, Microsoft and Sun Microsystems. InfiniBand was previously called System I/O.  InfiniBand transmission rates begin at 2.5GBps.

infinity
In digital photography terms, infinity refers to a distance great enough to be unaffected by finite variations. In practice this term describes most subjects beyond 1,000 meters or, in landscape terms, the horizon. See "A Quick Guide to Digital Cameras" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia. See also Megapixel.net for news, reviews and a active community for digital camera and photography enthusiasts.

influencer
In the blogosphere, an influencer is a person who blogs about a specific subject and is highly recognized online as an expert. An influencer differs from an A-list blogger in that they are often able to sway other's opinions and thoughts on the subject matter.

infomediary
Formed from a combination of the words information and intermediary, an infomediary is a Web site that gathers and organizes large amounts of data and acts as an intermediary between those who want the information and those who supply the information.  There are two types of infomediaries. Some infomediaries, such as Autobytel.com and BizRate.com, offer consumers a place to gather information about specific products and companies before they make purchasing decisions. The infomediary is a neutral entity, a third-party provider of unbiased information; it does not promote or try to sell specific products in preference over other products. It does not act on behalf of any vendors. The second type of infomediary, and one that is not necessarily Web-based, is one that provides vendors with consumer information that will help the vendor develop and market products. The infomediary collects the personal information from the buyers and markets that data to businesses. The advantage of this approach is that consumer privacy is protected and some infomediaries even offer consumers a percentage of the brokerage deals.  The term infomediary was coined by John Hagel in his 1996 article entitled "The Coming Battle for Customer Information" in the Harvard Business Review.

Information_and_Content_Exchange
Abbreviated as ICE, an XML-based standard protocol for content syndication over the Internet. The protocol uses XML meta tags to define the format of content transaction messages sent between servers. The syndicated content is typically a download that is automatically transmitted for an agreed-upon price. Because an ICE server is often integrated with a content management system, neither the supplier or content recipient needs to be concerned with manually formatting the syndicated data.

information_classification_and_management
Abbreviated as ICM, information classification and management is a class of application-independent software that use advanced indexing, classification, policy and data access capabilities to automate data management activities above the storage layer.

information_hiding
(1) In programming, the process of hiding details of an object or function. Information hiding is a powerful programming technique because it reduces complexity. One of the chief mechanisms for hiding information is encapsulation -- combining elements to create a larger entity. The programmer can then focus on the new object without worrying about the hidden details. In a sense, the entire hierarchy of programming languages, from machine languages to high-level languages, can be seen as a form of information hiding.
Information hiding is also used to prevent programmers from intentionally or unintentionally changing parts of a program.
(2) Another term for digital watermarking.

information_highway
A popular buzzword to describe the Internet, bulletin board services, online services, and other services that enable people to obtain information from telecommunications networks. In the U.S., there is currently a national debate about how to shape and control these avenues of information. Many people believe that the information highway should be designed and regulated by government, just like conventional highway systems. Others argue that government should adopt a more laissez faire attitude. Nearly everyone agrees that accessing the information highway is going to be a normal part of everyday life in the near future.  

information_interoperability
Information interoperability describes the ability to meaningfully exchange information among separately developed information technology (IT) systems. This means the separate systems are able to understand the format, meaning and also the quality of the information being exchanged.

information_silo
In business management and information technology (IT)  a silo describes any management system that is unable to operate with any other system. It's closed off from other systems which creates an environment of individual and disparate systems within an organization.
Why Silos Occur
Organizational silos typically do not share the same priorities, goals or even the same tools, so departments operate as individual business units or entities within the enterprise. Silos typically occur because of how an organization is structured. Managers are responsible for one specific department within an organization and each manager has different priorities, responsibilities and vision. Often, managers are not aware of the priorities and goals of other departments and there is little communication, collaboration and teamwork between these business units.


information_technology_IT_architect
The information technology architect applies IT resources to meet specific business requirements. The role requires a high degree of technical expertise as well as business understanding, as IT architects determine which information technology investments will yield the best return, both in terms of hard costs and productivity benefits.

infotainment
A term and popular buzzword for a media device or service that delivers a combination of information and entertainment. The content delivered via infotainment is designed to be informative yet entertaining enough to attract and maintain the consumer's interest. 
Infotainment can refer to a variety of content served through traditional media such as television, print, radio or the Internet. Television channels like Animal Planet and the Food Network are prime examples of media serving infotainment content. The term infotainment is also frequently applied to devices designed to serve infotainment content, such as in-car entertainment and information systems (in-vehicle infotainment).

infrared
Abbreviated as IR, infrared is a wave of light that in the area beyond the visible part of the color spectrum. While it is invisible to human eye infrared is often used to enhance visibility when using night vision devices.

infrastructure
The term infrastructure in an information technology (IT) context refers to an enterprise's entire collection of hardware, software, networks, data centers, facilities and related equipment used to develop, test, operate, monitor, manage and/or support information technology services.
A company's IT infrastructure includes the physical IT devices and products, but does not include the employees, documentation or processes used in operating and managing IT services.
From Infrastructures to Converged and Hyper-Converged Infrastructure Systems
Two infrastructure-related terms that have become increasingly relevant in recent years are converged infrastructure and hyper-converged infrastructure systems. The former refers to an optimized, tightly-integrated collection of IT components offered by a systems vendor that includes a variety of compute, storage, networking and virtualization resources.

infrastructure_mode
An 802.11 networking framework in which devices communicate with each other by first going through an Access Point (AP). In infrastructure mode, wireless devices can communicate with each other or can communicate with a wired network. When one AP is connected to wired network and a set of wireless stations it is referred to as a Basic Service Set (BSS). An Extended Service Set (ESS) is a set of two or more BSSs that form a single subnetwork. Most corporate wireless LANs operate in infrastructure mode because they require access to the wired LAN in order to use services such as file servers or printers.  Compare with ad-hoc mode.

Ingres
An open source RDBMS that started as a research project at Berkeley in the 1970's. There are now two strains of Ingres; the university Ingres (also known as Berkeley Ingres), which is open source, and also a commercial version called OpenIngres, which uses SQL and some forms of QUEL as its language for queries and database transactions. The university Ingres is believed to be the first implementation of a relational database management system that pre-dates IBM's System R. Version 8.9 was the last public release of University Ingres and it was discontinued in 1985. Ingres is also written as INGRES.

ingress_traffic
(in´gres traf´ik) (n.) Network traffic that originates from outside of the network��s routers and proceeds toward a destination inside of the network. For example, an e-mail message that is considered ingress traffic will originate somewhere outside of a enterprise��s LAN, pass over the Internetand enter the company��s LAN before it is delivered to the recipient.
Compare with egress traffic.

inheritance
In object-oriented programing (OOP) inheritance is a feature that represents the "is a" relationship between different classes. Inheritance allows a class to have the same behavior as another class and extend or tailor that behavior to provide special action for specific needs. 

init
(1) On Macintoshes an old term (before System 7) for System  extensions. See under extension.  (2) Short for initialize or initialization. 

initial_program_load
Short for initial program load, the process of loading the operating system of a mainframe into the computer's main memory. IPL is the mainframe equivalent of booting or rebooting a personal computer.

initialize
(1) On Apple Macintosh computers, initializing a disk means formatting it.  (2) In programming, initialize means to assign a starting value to a variable.  (3) Initialize can refer to the process of starting up a program or system.  

ink_jet_printer
A type of printer that works by spraying ionized ink at a sheet of paper. Magnetized plates in the ink's path direct the ink onto the paper in the desired shapes. Ink-jet printers are capable of producing high quality print approaching that produced by laser printers. A typical ink-jet printer provides a resolution of 300 dots per inch, although some newer models offer higher resolutions.
In general, the price of ink-jet printers is lower than that of laser printers. However, they are also considerably slower. Another drawback of ink-jet printers is that they require a special type of ink that is apt to smudge on inexpensive copier paper.
Because ink-jet printers require smaller mechanical parts than laser printers, they are especially popular as portable printers. In addition, color ink-jet printers provide an inexpensive way to print full-color documents.

Inmarsat_4_satellite
Flagged as "broadband for a mobile planet" the Inmarsat-4 Satellite is Inmarsat's first step in providing the next-generation of mobile services, including BGAN. The Inmarsat-4s will speed through space at 6,875 mph. The satellites will sit in geostationary orbit, where they will be synchronized with the rotational speed of the Earth and appear to "hover" over the Equator.  They will bring about a 16-fold increase in the traffic-bearing capacity of the Inmarsat network  and will extend high-speed data into space, creating a truly global broadband network.  Much of the I-4 traffic will be carried as Internet Protocol (IP) packet-switched data. The network will also be powerful enough to support circuit-switched applications, such as voice, ISDN and fax.  See also BGAN.

inode
(ī´nōd) (n.) Data structures that contain information about files in Unix file systems that are created when a file system is created. Each file has an inode and is identified by an inode number (i-number) in the file system where it resides. inodes provide important information on files such as user and group ownership, access mode (read, write, execute permissions) and type.
There are a set number of inodes, which indicates the maximum number of files the system can hold.
A file's inode number can be found using the ls -i command, while the ls -lcommand will retrieve inode information.

InPrivate_Browsing
A feature of the Internet Explorer 8 Web browser that lets users surf the Web without browsing history, temporary Internet files, form data, cookies, and usernames and passwords being retained by the browser. This is a more private browsing option that, according to Microsoft, leaves no evidence of your browsing or search history.   You can start InPrivate Browsing using Internet Explorer 8 by opening a new tab and selecting Browse with InPrivate or selecting it from the Safety button on the top right corner of the browser window. Internet Explorer 8 will launch a new browser session that won't record any information. To end your InPrivate Browsing session, simply close the browser window.  See "What Is A Temporary Internet File?" in Webopedia's Did You Know...? section. See also "What Do You Do With Internet Cookies?" in Webopedia's Did You Know...? section.

(v.)The act of entering data into a computer.


input_device
Any machine that feeds data into a computer. For example, a keyboard is an input device, whereas a display monitor is an output device. Input devices other than the keyboard are sometimes called alternate input devices. Mice, trackballs, and light pensare all alternate input devices.


input_output
Short for input/output (pronounced "eye-oh"). The term I/O is used to describe any program, operation or device that transfers data to or from a computer and to or from a peripheral device. Every transfer is an output from one device and an input into another. Devices such as keyboards and mouses are input-only devices while devices such as printers are output-only. A writable CD-ROM is both an input and an output device.

INS
Short for Internal Nonhostile Structured, it is a threat defined by Symantec Corporation to mean an individual within an organization who has physical access to network components. This individual may not motivated to disrupt mission operations but can do so by making common mistakes. Individuals executing INS threats are usually skilled and have tools to assist them in performing security-related functions. Contrast with INU (Internal Nonhostile Unstructured).

Ins_key
A key on computer keyboards that turns insert mode on and off. The Insert key does not work for all programs, but most word processors and text editors support it. 

insert
To place an object between two other objects. Inserting characters, words, paragraphs and documents is common in word processing. Note that insert differs from append, which means to add at the end.  Most computer keyboards have an Insert key, which turns insert mode on and off.  

Insert_key
A key on computer keyboards that turns insert mode on and off. The Insert key does not work for all programs, but most word processors and text editors support it. 

insert_mode
Most text editors and word processors have two text entry modes from which you can choose. In insert mode, the editor inserts all characters you type at the cursor position (or to the right of the insertion point). With each new insertion, the editor pushes over characters to the right of the cursor or pointer to make room for the new character.  If insert mode is turned off, the editor overwrites existing characters instead of inserting the new ones before the old ones. This is often called overstrike (or overwrite) mode. Most PC keyboards have an Ins key that lets you switch back and forth between insert and overwrite modes.  For most programs, the default text entry mode is insert mode.  

insertion_point
In graphics-based programs, the insertion point is the point where the next characters typed from the keyboard will appear on the display screen. The insertion point is usually represented by a blinking vertical line. You can reposition the insertion point by pressing arrow keys or by moving the I-beam pointer.


insider_attack
Any malicious attacks on a corporate system or network where the intruder is someone who has been entrusted with authorized access to the network, and also may have knowledge of the network architecture. An internal intrusion detection system (IDS) system is one measure that can help organizations limit the risk from insider attacks. Also see The Difference Between a Virus, Worm and Trojan Horse in the Did You Know? section of Webopedia.

instagram
Instagram is the name of an online photo sharing social Web service that lets you share your life with friends through a series of pictures captured with a mobile device. Instagram also supports video uploads and lets users of the service instantly share photos on several social sites, including Flickr, Facebook, Tumblr and Twitter or specify a location with any photo to check in on Foursquare.
The Instagram service, which claims to have more than 100 million users, was founded by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger in October, 2010. In April, 2012, Facebook acquired Instagram for $300 million in cash and 23 million shares of stock -- a total purchase value of nearly $1 billion.

instant_messaging
Abbreviated IM, a type of communications service that enables you to create a kind of private chat room with another individual in order to communicate in real time over the Internet, analagous to a telephone conversation but using text-based, not voice-based, communication. Typically, the instant messaging system alerts you whenever somebody on your private list is online. You can then initiate a chat session with that particular individual.
See the page of text messaging abbreviations in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

instruction
A basic command. The term instruction is often used to describe the most rudimentary programming commands. For example, a computer's instruction set is the list of all the basic commands in the computer's machine language.


instruction_cycle
The time period during which one instruction is fetched from memory and executed when a computer is given an instruction in machine language. There are typically four stages of an instruction cycle that the CPUcarries out:

Fetch the instruction from memory. This step brings the instruction into the instruction register, a circuit that holds the instruction so that it can be decoded and executed.
Decode the instruction.
Read the effective address from memory if the instruction has an indirect address.
Execute the instruction.

Steps 1 and 2 are called the fetch cycle and are the same for each instruction. Steps 3 and 4 are called the execute cycleand will change with each instruction.
The term refers to both the series of four steps and also the amount of time that it takes to carry out the four steps.

instruction_register
See under instruction cycle.

instruction_set
(n.) Also called a command set, the basic set of commands, or instructions, that a microprocessor understands. One of the principal characteristics that separates RISC from CISC microprocessors is the size of the instruction set -- RISC microprocessors have relatively small instruction sets whereas CISC processors have relatively large instruction sets. 

Instruction_Level_Parallelism
Abbreviated as ILP, Instruction-Level Parallelism is a measurement of the number of operations that can be performed simultaneously in a computer program. Microprocessors exploit ILP by executing multiple instructions from a single program in a single cycle.

Intarweb
Intarweb is a sarcastic-like slang word used to refer to the Internet, or more specifically, the World Wide Web. Usually the term is used to describe the masses of unknowledgeable users logging on to the Internet (e.g., a user might say to a new person, in jest, "So you've joined the Intarweb, did you?").

integer
A whole number. The following are integers:  0  1  -125  144457  In contrast, the following are not integers:  5.34  -1.0  1.3E4  "string"  The first three are floating-point numbers; the last is a character string.  Integers, floating-point numbers, and character strings constitute the basic data types that most computers  support. There are often different sizes of integers available; for example, PCs support short integers, which are 2 bytes, and long integers, which are 4 bytes.  

integrated
(1) A popular computer buzzword that refers to two or more components merged together into a single system. For example, any software product that performs more than one task can be described as integrated.  (2) Increasingly, the term integrated software  is reserved for applications that combine word processing, database management, spreadsheet functions, and communications into a single package.  

integrated_circuit_IC
Another name for a chip, an integrated circuit (IC) is a small electronic device made out of a semiconductor material. The first integrated circuit was developed in the 1950s by Jack Kilby of Texas Instrumentsand Robert Noyce of Fairchild Semiconductor.
Integrated circuits are used for a variety of devices, including microprocessors, audio and video equipment, and automobiles. Integrated circuits are often classified by the number of transistors and other electronic components they contain:

SSI (small-scale integration):Up to 100 electronic components per chip
MSI (medium-scale integration):From 100 to 3,000 electronic components per chip
LSI  (large-scale integration):From 3,000 to 100,000 electronic components per chip

integrated_peripheral
A term used to describe a peripheral device that is housed within the main container of the computer. These internal devices -- such as a CD-ROM drive or an internal Zip drive -- are in contrast to external peripheral devices -- such as a keyboard, mouse or printer.

Intel
The world's largest manufacturer of computer chips. Although it has been challenged in recent years by newcomers AMD and Cyrix, Intel still dominates the market for PC microprocessors. Nearly all PCs are based on Intel's x86 architecture.  Intel was founded in 1968 by Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore. Strategically, it is closely allied with Microsoft because the Windows 3.x and 95 operating systems are designed for x86 microprocessors. The popularity of Windows creates a demand for Intel or Intel-compatible microprocessors. Many people refer to this alliance as Wintel (short for Windows-Intel).  

intel-compute-stick
The Intel Compute Stick is a small USB flash drive-sized PC-on-a-Stick device that can be plugged into an HDMI-compatible TV or monitor to provide a complete personal computing (PC) experience.
Intel announced its Compute Stick in March 2015, with the initial release powered by a quad-core Intel Atom system-on-a-chip (SoC) processor.  The Compute Stick is available in a $149 version running Microsoft Windows 8.1 or a $109 version running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
Both Intel Compute Stick versions include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support, a USB port, and a micro SD card slot for additional storage beyond the 8 GB of on-board storage in the Linux version and 32 GB of on-board storage in the Windows-based Intel Compute Stick.

intel_haswell
Haswell is the codename for Intel's processor microarchitecture that serves as the successor to the Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge architectures. Like Ivy Bridge, Haswell utilizes a 22nm (nanometer) die shrink fabrication process, and it serves as the "tock" in Intel's alternating tick-tock model of releasing new processor families. The "tick" to Haswell, codenamed Broadwell, will be fabricated on a 14nm die shrink.

Processors utilizing Haswell were officially announced and released by Intel in June 2013 as the "4th Generation Intel Core Processor Family," with each Haswell processor bearing a 4-digit number with an initial digit of "4." This follows the pattern of Ivy Bridge processors bearing a number in the "3xxx" range and Sandy Bridge processors falling in the "2xxx" range.

Intel_microprocessors
Microprocessors made by Intel Corporation form the foundation of all PCs.  Models after the 8086 are often referred to by the last three digits (for example, the 286, 386, and 486 ). Many of the microprocessors come in different varieties that run at various clock rates. The 80486 architecture, for example, supports clock rates of from 33 to 66 MHz. Because Intel discovered that it couldn't trademark its CPU numbers, it shifted to a naming scheme, starting with the Pentium processors. Intel's latest and sixth-generation chip is called the Pentium Pro.  All Intel microprocessors are backward compatible, which means that they can run programs written for a less powerful processor. The 80386, for example, can run programs written for the 8086, 8088, and 80286. The 80386 and later models, however, offer special programming features not available on previous models. Software written specifically for these processors, therefore, may not run on older microprocessors. The common architecture behind all Intel microprocessors is known as the x86 architecture.  Until the late 80s, Intel was essentially the only producer of PC microprocessors. Increasingly, however, Intel is facing competition from other manufacturers who produce "Intel-compatible " chips. These chips support the Intel instruction set and are often less expensive than Intel chips. In some cases, they also offer better performance. Two of the leading manufacturers of Intel-compatible chips are Cyrix and AMD.  

intel-skylake
Skylake is the codename for Intel's processor microarchitecture that serves as the successor to the Haswell and Broadwell architectures.
As with Broadwell, Intel Skylake utilizes a 14nm (nanometer) die shrink fabrication process, and it serves as the "tock" in Intel's alternating tick-tock model of releasing new processor families. The "tick" to Intel Skylake, codenamed Cannonlake, is expected to be fabricated on a 10nm die shrink.
Intel Skylake Set to Introduce a Wire-Free Computing Environment
In addition to delivering significant increases in performance, battery life and power efficiency, Intel Skylake processors will offer new wireless charging and data transfer capabilities for a wire-free computing environment. Skylake processors are expected to go into production in the second half of 2015, with Skylake systems available for purchase before the end of 2015.

Intel_V8
In multi-core technology, Intel V8 is the name used to reference the eight-core PC motherboard developed by Intel. Intel's V8 features two quad-core Xeon processors that have been built on to an Intel workstation motherboard. Also see "All About Dual-Core Processors" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia.

Intel_Virtualization_Technology
Intel Virtualization Technology (Intel VT) is a set of hardware enhancements to Intel server and client platforms that provide software-based virtualization solutions. Intel VT allows a platform to run multiple operating systems and applications in independent partitions, allowing one computer system can function as multiple virtual systems. See also "Understanding Hardware-Assisted Virtualization" in Webopedia's Did You Know section.

intellectual_property
Often abbreviated as IP, intellectual property refers to any property that is created using original thought. Traditional intellectual property rights include patents, copyrights and trademarks. Unlike tangible property, rights are not extinguished when the property is destroyed.

Intellifont
A scalable font technology that is part of Hewlett-Packard's PCL  5 page description language.  

intelligent_agent
Programs, used extensively on the Web, that perform tasks such as retrieving and delivering information and automating repetitive tasks. More than 50 companies are currently developing intelligent agent software or services, including Firefly and WiseWire.  Agents are designed to make computing easier. Currently they are used as Web browsers, news retrieval mechanisms, and shopping assistants. By specifying certain parameters, agents will "search" the Internet and return the results directly back to your PC.  Push technology relies on agents to deliver pre-selected information to your desktop. Some intelligent agents are also used as tools to track Web behavior: they can even "watch" as your surf the Net and record how often you visit certain sites. Later, they can be used to automatically download your favorite sites, let you know when your favorite site has been updated, and even tailor specific pages to suit your tastes. 

Intelligent_Exposure
In digital camera terminology, Intelligent Exposure is a function of the camera that helps to avoid blown highlights and blocked shadows by suppressing the extreme brightness and darkness in the picture. This function works by partially controlling the ISO sensitivity to increase the exposure of only the darkened area when there is backlighting or insufficient flash lighting to capture the scene as viewed by the photographer through the camera. Intelligent Exposure is a function found in many Panasonic brand digital cameras. On Nikon brand of digital cameras, the similar function is called D_Lighting. See "Digital Cameras" in the  Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

intelligent_information_management
Abbreviated as IIM, intelligent information management is a set of processes and underlying technology solutions that enable organizations to understand, organize and manage all sorts of data types (e.g., general files, databases and e-mails). Key attributes that define an IIM solution include the following:   Automated patching  Infrastructure database  Integrated IP device discovery  Alarms and events  Integration with third party applications  Data sharing   [Adapted from  BCS, Business IT Interface]

Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface_IPMI
Abbreviated as IPMI, the Intelligent Platform Management Interface is a remote hardware health monitoring and management system that defines interfaces for use in monitoring the physical health of servers, such as temperature, voltage, fans, power supplies and chassis. It was developed by Dell, HP, Intel and NEC, but has many more industry promoters, adopters and contributors. The IPMI Initiative derives its name from the main specification (IPMI), which defines the messages and system interface to platform management hardware. It comprises three specifications:   Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) Intelligent Platform Management Bus (IPMB)  Intelligent Chassis Management Bus (ICMB)   The IPMB specification defines an internal management bus for extending platform management within a chassis, while the ICMB specification defines the external management bus between IPMI-enabled systems. [Specifications adapted from the Intel IPMI Web page]

Intelligent_Printer_Data_Stream
Intelligent Printer Data Stream (IPDS) is the host-to-printer data stream used by  IBM's System Application Architecture (SAA) for Advanced Function Printing (AFP). The IPDS architecture defines the data stream used by print server programs and device drivers to manage all-points-addressable page printing on a full spectrum of devices from low-end workstation and local area network-attached (LAN-attached) printers to high-speed, high-volume page printers for production jobs, shared printing, and mailroom applications.  [Adapted from the IBM Printers Web site]. See also Advanced Function Presentation (AFP).

intelligent_terminal
A terminal (monitor and keyboard) that contains processing power. Intelligent terminals include memory and a processor to perform special display operations. In contrast, a dumb terminal has no processing capabilities; it must rely entirely on the central computer. A smart terminal has some processing capabilities, but not as much as an intelligent terminal.  

IntelliTXT
)IntelliTXT is a type of Internet advertising technology that scans a Web page for both appropriate keywords and contextual relevancy. The keywords are pre-chosen for relevancy, and, if a match is found, an advertising link, which is usually indicated by a green or yellow double underline, is automatically generated. Some Web pages will have no links while others may have as multiple links. Passing your mouse pointer over an indicated keyword will pop up a small box or "tool tip" that contains a short text advertisement. If you want to find more information, you simply click on the keyword as you would any hyperlink, and you'll be taken to the advertiser's Web site.

interactive
Accepting input from a human. Interactive computer systems are programs that allow users to enter data or commands. Most popular programs, such as word processors and spreadsheet applications, are interactive.  A noninteractive program is one that, when started, continues without requiring human contact. A compiler is a noninteractive program, as are all batch processing applications.  

interblock_gap
Same as interrecord gap.

Intercast
A protocol created by Intel in 1996 for broadcasting information, such as Web pages and programs, along with television signals to a PC. With Intercast, a user can watch television on one portion of a PC monitor while receiving relevant information often about the broadcast from the Web on another. To browse the Web for information not being broadcast or not stored on the PC, however, the user must have Internet access through an Internet Service Provider ; Intercast transmits in only one direction.   For example, CNN uses Intercast to broadcast text and links to its Web pages that accompany its TV coverage. To receive Intercast, a user needs a TV tuner add-in card and Intel Intercast Viewer software. 

interconnect
An electrical or optical connection or cable that connects two separate devices. For example, the cable that connects your monitor or hard drive to the computer system is called an interconnect. A standard computer system will contain multiple interconnects.

interface
(n.)A boundary across which two independent systems meet and act on or communicate with each other. In computer technology, there are several types of interfaces.

user interface - the keyboard, mouse, menus of a computer system. The user interface allows the user to communicate with the operating system. Also see GUI.
software interface - the languages and codes that the applications use to communicate with each other and with the hardware.
hardware interface - the wires, plugs and sockets that hardware devices use to communicate with each other.

(v.) To connect with or interact with by means of an interface.

Interior_Gateway_Routing_Protocol
(n.) Abbreviated as IGRP, a proprietary network protocol, developed by Cisco Systems, designed to work on autonomous systems. IGRP is a distance-vector routing protocol, which means that each router sends all or a portion of its routing table in a routing message update at regular intervals to each of its neighboring routers. A router chooses the best path between a source and a destination. Since each path can comprise many links, the system needs a way to compare the links in order to find the best path. A system such as RIP uses only one criteria -- hops -- to determine the best path. IGRP uses five criteria to determine the best path: the link's speed, delay, packet size, loading and reliability. Network administrators can set the weighting factors for each of these metrics.

interlaced_scan
Interlaced scan is one of two methods used for "painting" an image on a television screen (the other being progressive scan). Designed for the analog NTSC television system, interlaced scanning uses two fields to create a frame. One field contains all the odd lines in the image, the other contains all the even lines of the image. A television scans 60 fields every second (30 odd and 30 even). These two sets of 30 fields are combined to create a full frame every 1/30th of a second, resulting in a display of 30 frames per second. Drawbacks to interlaced scanning compared to progressive scanning include flicker, lower  resolution and quality issues. Compare with progressive scan.

interleaving
)To arrange data in a noncontiguous way to increase performance. When used to describe disk drives, it refers to the way sectors on a disk are organized. In one-to-one interleaving, the sectors are placed sequentially around each track. In two-to-one interleaving, sectors are staggered so that consecutively numbered sectors are separated by an intervening sector.  The purpose of interleaving is to make the disk drive more efficient. The disk drive can access only one sector at a time, and the disk is constantly spinning beneath the read/write head. This means that by the time the drive is ready to access the next sector, the disk may have already spun beyond it. If a data file spans more than one sector and if the sectors are arranged sequentially, the drive will need to wait a full rotation to access the next chunk of the file. If instead the sectors are staggered, the disk will be perfectly positioned to access sequential sectors.  The optimum interleaving factor depends on the speed of the disk drive, the operating system, and the application. The only way to find the best interleaving factor is to experiment with various factors and various applications.  Memory can also be interleaved. See interleaved memory for more information. 

interleaved_memory
Main memory divided into two or more sections. The CPU can access alternate sections immediately, without waiting for memory to catch up (through wait states). Interleaved memory is one technique for compensating for the relatively slow speed of dynamic RAM (DRAM). Other techniques include page-mode memory and memory caches.  

intermediate_distribution_frame
See IDF.

internal_bus
Another name for an internal data bus.  Also, an expansion bus is often referred to as an internal bus.

internal_cloud
Another name for a private cloud.

internal_command
In DOS systems, an internal command is any command that resides in the COMMAND.COM file. This includes the most common DOS commands, such as COPY and DIR. Commands that reside in other COM files, or in EXE or BAT files, are called external commands.  

internal_data_bus
A bus that operates only within the internal circuitry of the CPU, communicating among the internal caches of memory that are part of the CPU chip��s design. This bus is typically rather quick and is independent of the rest of the computer��s operations.  Contrast with external data bus. The bit width of internal and external data buses are not always equal.

internal_modem
)A modem that resides on an expansion board that plugs into a computer. In contrast, an external modem is a box that attaches to a computer's COM port via cables. 

International_Color_Consortium
The International Color Consortium was established in 1993 by eight industry vendors for the purpose of creating, promoting and encouraging the standardization and evolution of an open, vendor-neutral, cross-platform color management system architecture and components. The intent of the International Color Consortium profile format is to provide a cross-platform device profile format. Device profiles can be used to translate color data created on one device into another device's native color space. The acceptance of this format by operating system vendors allows end users to transparently move profiles and images with embedded profiles between different operating systems. [Source: International Color Consortium Web site]

internationalization
The principles and practices used in the designing and modification of a product to ensure it performs as expect when adapted for use in different languages and locales (internationalized). Internationalization is often abbreviated as I18N.

Internationalized_Domain_Name
Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) are domain names or Web addresses, represented by local language characters. When a user types an IDN in local language characters, an IDN resolution process is required to locate the corresponding Web site or e-mail address. The native language domain name will be followed by .com or .net. The goal of Internationalized Domain Names is to improve the international accessibility and functionality of the Internet by allowing users to register domain names in non-English languages.

internesia
(slang) Formed from the combination of Internet and amnesia, internesia is the inability to remember which Web site or other Internet-related location (such as e-mail or newsgroups) specific information came from. The more one uses the Internet, the more information one is exposed to. Bookmarking pages is one tool that helps users remember favorite Internet sites or backtrack to important information, but often bookmarking too many pages will only contribute to internesia.

Internet
The Internet is a global network connecting millions of computers. More than 190 countries are linked into exchanges of data, news and opinions.
Internet Users Worldwide
According to Internet Live Stats, as of August 07, 2015 there was an estimated 3,179,035,200 Internet users worldwide. The number of Internet users represents nearly 40 percent of the world's population. The largest number of Internet users by country is China, followed by the United States and India.
In September 2014, the total number of websites with a unique hostname online exceeded 1 billion. This is an increase from one website (info.cern.ch) in 1991. The first billion Internet users worldwide was reached in 2005.

Internet_address

Also called online desktop or Web desktop. See also SaaS (Software as a Service).

Internet_Explorer
A Web browser that made its debut in 1995 as Microsoft's response to Netscape, one of the first graphical-based Web browsers and, at the time, the dominant browser in use with control of over 90 percent of the market.
Initially called Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE), Internet Explorer (IE) has long held the title of most popular browser in use, despite strong competition from the likes of Mozilla Firefox, Apple's Safari, Opera and Google Chrome.
As with most modern browsers, Internet Explorer supports Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, RSS, CSS and Ajax, while also offering features like tabbed browsing, private browsing, and built-in malware and phishing protection.

internet_explorer_10
The successor to Microsoft's Internet Explorer 9 Web browser, Internet Explorer 10 (IE10) is integrated into the Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 operating systems, which made their official debuts on October 26th, 2012. Among other enhancements and performance improvements, Internet Explorer 10 significantly improves the browser's support for CSS3 and HTML5. Internet Explorer 10 can be run as a traditional desktop application or in Windows 8 Metro, and its engine powers the Metro applications that utilize HTML5 and JavaScript. IE10 will also be the default Web browser for smartphones and other mobile devices powered by the Windows Phone 8mobile operating system.
Internet Explorer 10 is currently available only as part of the Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 operating system releases. IE10 was originally expected to additionally run on the Windows 7 OS, but that issue has been in question recently as Microsoft focuses on the new operating system releases. Microsoft has said it will provide a preview release of the Web browser for Windows 7 in the near future.

Internet_fax
A device that uses IP networks to transport faxes instead of PSTN as its means of transporting a fax document. More specifically, Internet Fax uses e-mail as the transport medium. Internet fax services typically include e-mail to fax (fax from an existing e-mail application), fax to e-mail (receive faxes in your e-mail), and PC to fax (fax documents from your desktop).

Internet_game
Internet games are those that require a connection to the Internet to play, and is a type of PC game. Computer games with multiplayer capabilities can be referred to as Internet games, as are online only games which you play in your browser.

Internet_Key_Exchange
The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol is a key management protocol standard that is used in conjunction with the IPSec standard. IKE enhances IPSec by providing additional features, flexibility, and ease of configuration for the IPSec standard. IPSec can however, be configured without IKE. Benefits provided by IKE include:   Eliminates the need to manually specify all the IPSec security parameters in the crypto maps at both peers. Allows you to specify a lifetime for the IPSec security association. Allows encryption keys to change during IPSec sessions. Allows IPSec to provide anti-replay services. Permits Certification Authority (CA) support for a manageable, scalable IPSec implementation. Allows dynamic authentication of peers.  See also IPSec.

internet_marketing
Internet marketing, or online marketing, refers to advertising and marketing efforts that use the Web and email to drive direct sales via electronic commerce, in addition to sales leads from Web sites or emails. Internet marketing and online advertising efforts are typically used in conjunction with traditional types of advertising such as radio, television, newspapers and magazines.
Specialized Areas of Internet Marketing
Internet marketing can also be broken down into more specialized areas such as Web marketing, email marketing and social media marketing:
1) Web marketing includes e-commerce Web sites, affiliate marketing Web sites, promotional or informative Web sites, online advertising on search engines, and organic search engine results via search engine optimization (SEO).

internet_meme
An Internet meme is a concept or idea that spreads "virally" from one person to another via the Internet. An Internet meme could be anything from an image to an email or video file; however, the most common meme is an image of a person or animal with a funny or witty caption. The proliferation of social media has led to Internet memes spreading very quickly and reaching more people.
Many Internet memes use humor and appeal largely to the adolescent and post-adolescent demographic: this demographic is much more likely to discover Internet memes, understand the humor behind them and be willing to forward it on to friends.
One of the most famous Internet memes is "LOLcat," which features cute pictures of cats with witty or funny captions.

Internet_over_Satellite
IoS is a term that can refer to either Internet over Satellite or Apple's iOS mobile operating system.
In the former case, Internet over Satellite (IoS) technology allows a user to access the Internet via a satellite that orbits the earth. A satellite is placed at a static point above the earth's surface. The satellite in a fixed position, also referred to as geostationary or geosynchronous, is able to maintain a reliable connection to the antennas on the earth because the satellite orbits the earth at the exact speed of the earth's rotation.
Because of the enormous distances signals must travel from the earth up to the satellite and back again, IoS is slightly slower than high-speed terrestrial connections over copper or fiber optic cables. In remote regions of the world, Internet over Satellite is the only viable option as installing the cable backbone necessary for Internet connection is not economically feasible or physically possible.

Internet_phone
Internet phones, or IP phones, use packet-switched VoIP, or Internet telephony, to transmit telephone calls over the Internet as opposed to the circuit-switched telephony used by the traditional Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).  The advantage to Internet phone calls is that unlike regular long-distance calls, online phone calls are free -- there's no fees beyond the cost of your Internet access.
Also referred to as online phones, an Internet phone can be a physical telephone with built-in IP technology and an  RJ-45 Ethernet connector instead of the RJ-11 phone connector found in standard phones, or it can be a voice-capable computer that uses VoIP hardware such as MagicJack or software like Skype.  This flexibility makes it possible for IP phone calls to function as Internet phone-to-phone, Internet phone-to-PC, PC-to-PC or PC-to-phone calls.
See  The Difference Between VoIP and PSTN Systems in the   Did You Know... ? section of Webopedia.Also see the   VoIP Meets Wi-Fi article in the   Did You Know? section of Webopedia. 

Internet_protocol_television
Internet protocol television, or IPTV, uses a two-way digital broadcast signal that is sent through a switched telephone or cable network by way of a broadband connection, along with a set top box programmed with software that can handle viewer requests to access media sources. A television is connected to the set top box that handles the task of decoding the IP video and converts it into standard television signals. The Switched Video Service (SVS) system allows viewers to access broadcast network channels, subscription services, and movies on demand. *

Internet_radio
An audio broadcasting service that is transmitted through the Internet. Internet radio is similar in nature to Internet broadcasting, also called  webcasting. However, those listening to the continuous stream audio broadcast have no control over the stream, similar to traditional radio broadcasting. Many radio stations worldwide offer their broadcast via Internet radio to a worldwide audience. Today dedicated hardware devices, commonly called Web radio or Internet radio appliances , can be purchased that connect to a home network and then to the Internet to play live audio streams. Internet radio is also called e-radio.

Internet_radio_appliance
Also called Web radio. See under Internet radio.

Internet_sharing
Also known as Internet connection sharing.

Internet_Society
A non-governmental, non-profit organization dedicated to maintaining and enhancing the Internet. Through its committees, such as the Internet Advisory Board and the Internet Engineering Task Force, the Internet Society is responsible for developing and approving new Internet standards and protocols.  

Internet_software_piracy
A type of software piracy that occurs when software, which is illegally obtained through Internet channels, usually through peer-to-peer file sharing systems or downloaded from pirate Web sites that make software available for download for free or in exchange for users who uploaded software. Internet software piracy also includes the sale of  counterfeit software on Internet auction and classified ads Web sites.  Counterfeit software with de-activate the copy-protection that can be obtained through Internet channels is called warez. See software piracy. Also see"Is Software Ownership the Same as Licensing?" in the in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia.

Internet_telephony
A category of hardware and software that enables people to use the Internet as the transmission medium for telephone calls. For users who have free, or fixed-price Internet access, Internet telephony software essentially provides free telephone calls anywhere in the world. To date, however, Internet telephony does not offer the same quality of telephone service as direct telephone connections.
There are many Internet telephony applications available. Some, like CoolTalk and NetMeeting, come bundled with popular Web browsers. Others are stand-alone products. Internet telephony products are sometimes called IP telephony, Voice over the Internet (VOI) or Voice over IP (VOIP)products.


Internet2
Internet2 is a testing-ground networking environment where universities, companies, and government laboratories work together and develop advanced Internet technologies such as telemedicine, digital libraries and virtual laboratories.  Using state-of-the-art infrastructure, Internet2 members are connected to the Abilene network backbone, which uses regional network aggregation points called gigaPoPs. The Abilene Network operates at 10 gigabits per second and supports transfer rates 100 to 1000 times faster than typical broadband connections. In October of 1996, 34 U.S. research universities began working on Internet2, and in September of 1997, the University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development (UCAID) was created to give an organizational body to the project. Today, with more than 300 member organizations, the Internet2 community currently includes more than 4 million individuals.

internetworking
(n.) The art and science of connecting individual local-area networks (LANs)  to create wide-area networks (WANs) , and connecting WANs to form even larger WANs. Internetworking can be extremely complex because it generally involves connecting networks that use different protocols. Internetworking is accomplished with routers, bridges, and gateways.  Other forms: internetwork (v.) 

InterNIC
Short for Internet Network Information Center, a registered service mark of the U.S. Department of Commerce and now a defunct entity. InterNIC began as a collaborative project between AT&T and Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI) supported by the National Science Foundation. When active, the project offered four services:  InterNIC Directory and Database Services -- online white pages directory and directory of publicly accessible databases managed by AT&T. Registration Services -- domain name and IP address assignment managed by NSI. Support Services -- outreach, education, and information services for the Internet community managed by NSI. Net Scout Services -- online publications that summarize recent happenings of interest to Internet users (managed by NSI).   The InterNIC is currently an informational Web site established to provide the public with information about domain name registration. ICANN now oversees the domain name registration industry.

interoperability
The ability of software and hardware on different machines from different vendors to share data.


interpreter
A program that executes instructions written in a high-level language. There are two ways to run programs written in a high-level language. The most common is to compile the program; the other method is to pass the program through an interpreter.
An interpreter translates high-level instructions into an intermediate form, which it then executes. In contrast, a compiler translates high-level instructions directly into machine language. Compiled programs generally run faster than interpreted programs. The advantage of an interpreter, however, is that it does not need to go through the compilation stage during which machine instructions are generated. This process can be time-consuming if the program is long. The interpreter, on the other hand, can immediately execute high-level programs. For this reason, interpreters are sometimes used during the development of a program, when a programmer wants to add small sections at a time and test them quickly. In addition, interpreters are often used in education because they allow students to program interactively.
Both interpreters and compilers are available for most high-level languages. However, BASIC and LISP are especially designed to be executed by an interpreter. In addition, page description languages, such as PostScript, use an interpreter. Every PostScript printer, for example, has a built-in interpreter that executes PostScript instructions.

interprocess_communication_IPC
A capability supported by some operating systems that allows one process to communicate with another process. The processes can be running on the same computer or on different computers connected through a network.
IPC enables one application to control another application, and for several applications to share the same data without interfering with one another. IPC is required in all multiprocessing systems, but it is not generally supported by single-process operating systems such as DOS. OS/2 and MS-Windows support an IPC mechanism called DDE . 


interrupt
(n.) A signal informing a program that an event has occurred. When a program receives an interrupt signal, it takes a specified action (which can be to ignore the signal). Interrupt signals can cause a program to suspend itself temporarily to service the interrupt.
Interrupt signals can come from a variety of sources. For example, every keystroke generates an interrupt signal. Interrupts can also be generated by other devices, such as a printer, to indicate that some event has occurred. These are called hardware  interrupts. Interrupt signals initiated by programs are called software  interrupts. A software interrupt is also called a trap or an exception.
PCs support 256 types of software interrupts and 15 hardware interrupts. Each type of software interrupt is associated with an interrupt handler -- a routine that takes control when the interrupt occurs. For example, when you press a key on your keyboard, this triggers a specific interrupt handler. The complete list of interrupts and associated interrupt handlers is stored in a table called the interrupt vector table, which resides in the first 1 K of addressable memory.

interrupt_vector_table
A table of interrupt vectors (pointers to routines that handle interrupts). On PCs, the interrupt vector table consists of 256 4-byte pointers, and resides in the first 1 K of addressable memory. Each interrupt number is reserved for a specific purpose. For example, 16 of the vectors are reserved for the 16 IRQ lines.  An interrupt vector table is also called a dispatch table. Also see the list of IRQ numbers in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

interstitial
Meaning in between, an advertisement that appears in a separate browser window while you wait for a Web page to load. Interstitials are more likely to contain large graphics, streaming presentations, and applets than conventional banner ads, and some studies have found that more users click on interstitials than on banner ads. Some users, however, have complained that interstitials slow access to destination pages.   

intervision_network
Intervision Network is the corporate name of an IP broadcasting development and related technologies company. Founded in 2005 and publicly traded as of January 2008 as InterVision Network Corporation (OTC: IVSW), IVNET develops original programming and distributes entertainment and business content for corporate partners.

Intranet
An intranet is a network based on TCP/IP protocols (an internet) belonging to an organization, usually a corporation, accessible only by the organization's members, employees, or others with authorization. An intranet's Web sites look and act just like any other Web sites, but the firewall surrounding an intranet fends off unauthorized access.
How Intranets Are Used
Like the Internet itself, intranets are used to share information. Secure intranets are now the fastest-growing segment of the Internet because they are much less expensive to build and manage than private networks based on proprietary protocols.

intranet_suite
(in´tra-net swēt) (n.) A generic term for a collection of Internet- and Web-based software and tools that can be adapted by a business to meet its technology needs when forming, using and maintaining an intranet. The components of an intranet suite typically include indexing and search capabilities, workflow monitoring, messaging (including e-mail and instant messaging), access control, document management and groupware.

intrinsic_attenuation
In fiber optic transmissions it is one of two main categorized factors which cause attenuation (the reduction of signal strength during transmission). Intrinsic attenuation is caused by manufacturing impurities in the glass, which typically causes absorption or scattering when the light hits the glass.  See also extrinsic attenuation.

intro
Slang for introduction, in video editing it is the beginning of the video.

intrusion_detection_system
An intrusion detection system (IDS) inspects all inbound and outbound network activity and identifies suspicious patterns that may indicate a network or system attack from someone attempting to break into or compromise a system.
There are several ways to categorize an IDS:

misuse detection vs. anomaly detection: in misuse detection, the IDS analyzes the information it gathers and compares it to large databases of attack signatures. Essentially, the IDS looks for a specific attack that has already been documented. Like a virus detection system, misuse detection software is only as good as the database of attack signatures that it uses to compare packets against. In anomaly detection, the system administrator defines the baseline, or normal, state of the network��s traffic load, breakdown, protocol, and typical packet size. The anomaly detector monitors network segments to compare their state to the normal baseline and look for anomalies.
network-based vs. host-based systems: in a network-based system, or NIDS, the individual packets flowing through a network are analyzed. The NIDS can detect malicious packets that are designed to be overlooked by a firewall��s simplistic filtering rules. In a host-based system, the IDS examines at the activity on each individual computer or host.
passive system vs. reactive system: in a passive system, the IDS detects a potential security breach, logs the information and signals an alert. In a reactive system, the IDS responds to the suspicious activity by logging off a user or by reprogramming the firewall to block network traffic from the suspected malicious source.

Though they both relate to network security, an IDS differs from a firewall in that a firewall looks out for intrusions in order to stop them from happening. The firewall limits the access between networks in order to prevent intrusion and does not signal an attack from inside the network. An IDS evaluates a suspected intrusion once it has taken place and signals an alarm. An IDS also watches for attacks that originate from within a system.

intrusion_prevention_system
An IPS, or intrusion prevention system is used in computer security. It provides policies and rules for network traffic along with an intrusion detection system for alerting system or network administrators to suspicious traffic, but allows the administrator to provide the action upon being alerted. Some compare an IPS to a combination of IDS and an application layer firewall for protection.

intrusion_signature
Recorded evidence of a system intrusion, typically as part of an intrusion detection system (IDS). When a malicious attack is launched against a system, the attack typically leaves evidence of the intrusion in the system��s logs. Each intrusion leaves a kind of footprint behind (e.g., unauthorized software executions, failed logins, misuse of administrative privileges, file and directory access) that administrators can document and use to prevent the same attacks in the future. By keeping tables of intrusion signatures and instructing devices in the IDS to look for the intrusion signatures, a system��s security is strengthened against malicious attacks.  Because each signature is different, it is possible for system administrators to determine by looking at the intrusion signature what the intrusion was, how and when it was perpetrated, and even how skilled the intruder is.

INU
Short for Internal Nonhostile Unstructured, it is a threat defined by Symantec Corporation to mean an individual within an organization who has physical access to network components. This individual is not motivated to disrupt mission operations but can do so unknowingly. INU threats are typically unskilled users who make mistakes that can impact mission operations. Contrast with INS (Internal Nonhostile Structured).

invalid_page_fault
A page fault that produces an error. Page fault errors can occur for any of the following reasons:  The virtual memory system becomes unstable due to a shortage of physical memory (RAM). The virtual memory system becomes unstable due to a shortage of free disk space. The virtual memory area is corrupted by a misbehaving application. An application attempts to access data that is being modified by another running application.   The first two causes are the most common. These conditions can also cause a general protection fault (GPF).  An invalid page fault is also called a page fault error (PFE). 

inventory_software
Software designed to help businesses manage inventory, sales, purchasing, shipping and related functions. Inventory management software solutions often work with barcode,  RFID and wireless tracking technology to support inventory tracking and control.  The general term of inventory software can encompass additional aspects of a company's operations -- including warehouse management systems, supply chain management and operations management -- in tracking products or components as they move from vendors to warehouses, between warehouses, and finally to retail locations or directly to customers.
See   All About Software: categories of applications software explained.Also  see   RFID Explained.

Inverse_Multiplexer
Abbreviated as IMUX, an Inverse Multiplexor combines multiple network channels to one aggregate higher speed pipe. It defines all forms of bonding or bundling two or more physical connections between two locations to create the single and faster virtual circuit.  Inverse Multiplexer is also spelled Inverse Multiplexor. See also multiplexer.

inverted_network
An inverted network design employs the philosophy that that security should be focused at the core of the network rather than on the perimeter (where firewalls, anti-virus and iintrusion detection systems would typically sit). Recognizing the increasingly threats to the enterprise network come from with, even internal LANs  and every component connected to it  are considered "dirty." For example, in an inverted network, VPN connections would be established from the desktop to the server.

invisible_text
See under keyword stuffing.

invisible_Web
(n.) Also referred to as the deep Web, the term refers to either Web pages that cannot be indexed by a typical search engine or Web pages that a search engine purposely does not index, rendering the data "invisible" to the general user. One of the most common reasons that a Web site��s content is not indexed is because of the site��s use of dynamic databases, which opens the door for a potential spider trap. Web pages can also fall into the invisible Web if there are no links leading to them, since search engine spiders typically crawl through links that lead them from one destination to another. Data on the invisible Web is not inaccessible; the information is out there-it is stored on a Web server somewhere and can be accessed using a browser-but the data must be found using means other than the general-purpose search engines, such as Google and Yahoo!.

invocation
The execution of a program or function.  

invoke
To activate. One usually speaks of invoking a function or routine in a program. In this sense, the term invoke is synonymous with call.  

IOPS
IOPS is the standard unit of measurement for I/O (Input/Output) operations per second. This measurement is a performance-based measurement and is usually seen written as:

Total IOPS: Average number of I/O operations per second.
Read IOPS: Average number of read I/O operations per second.
Write IOPS: Average number of write I/O operations per second.


IoS
IoS is a term that can refer to either Internet over Satellite or Apple's iOS mobile operating system.
In the former case, Internet over Satellite (IoS) technology allows a user to access the Internet via a satellite that orbits the earth. A satellite is placed at a static point above the earth's surface. The satellite in a fixed position, also referred to as geostationary or geosynchronous, is able to maintain a reliable connection to the antennas on the earth because the satellite orbits the earth at the exact speed of the earth's rotation.
Because of the enormous distances signals must travel from the earth up to the satellite and back again, IoS is slightly slower than high-speed terrestrial connections over copper or fiber optic cables. In remote regions of the world, Internet over Satellite is the only viable option as installing the cable backbone necessary for Internet connection is not economically feasible or physically possible.

internet_of_things
IoT is short for Internet of Things.
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the ever-growing network of physical objects that feature an IP address for internet connectivity, and the communication that occurs between these objects and other Internet-enabled devices and systems.
IoT Extends Internet Connectivity
The Internet of Things extends internet connectivity beyond traditional devices like desktop and laptop computers, smartphones and tablets to a diverse range of devices and everyday things that utilize embedded technology to communicate and interact with the external environment, all via the Internet.

IOTP
Internet Open Trading Protocol is an IETF specification which defines a way to create a trading environment that is more reliable and personal than existing methods by giving the consumer more opportunities to interact directly with all parties of a transaction.   IOTP focuses on the transaction process; therefore, it is application and payment system independent.   IOTP relies on standard "Trading Components" to define and keep track of all the stages of an e-commerce transaction. Parties involved use these Trading Components to send and receive the necessary information (always in XML format) to execute the deal.  Here's an example of how a simple payment-exchange transaction works:   Let's say a consumer shows interest in a merchant's product.   The merchant decides which payment brands (Visa, MasterCard, DigiCash, etc.,), protocols, and currency denominations he will accept. He then sends that info to the consumer using the Brand List Component.   The consumer makes his choices and sends them back to the merchant using a Brand Selection Component.   The merchant creates a Payment Component that details the payment selection and provides payment directions. He also creates an Organization Component that recognizes the payment handler and merchant roles.   The consumer checks the information, then uses the Status Component to let the payment handler know the deal is good to go.   The payment handler checks the information. If everything looks legit, he swaps Payment Scheme Components for payment brand and payment protocol.   Finally, receipt is delivered to the consumer via the Payment Receipt Component.   As transactions become more complex and involve more players, the need for more Trading Components becomes necessary. 

IP
(pronounced as separate letters) Short for Internet Protocol. IP specifies the format of packets, also called datagrams, and the addressing scheme. Most networks combine IP with a higher-level protocol called Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which establishes a virtual connection between a destination and a source.
IP by itself is something like the postal system. It allows you to address a package and drop it in the system, but there's no direct link between you and the recipient. TCP/IP, on the other hand, establishes a connection between two hosts so that they can send messages back and forth for a period of time.
The current version of IP is IPv4. A new version, called IPv6 or IPng, is under development.

IP_address

 
 

IP_blocking
IP blocking is a form of security used on mail, Web or any other Internet servers to block connections from a specific  IP address or range of addresses that are considered undesirable or hostile. For example, a Web site forum administrator who sees spam or unwanted posts from a user may block that user's IP address to prevent them from using the discussion board. See IP address. See also blacklist.

IP_faxing
(n.) Using an IP-based network, especially the Internet, to transmit faxes. IP faxing is similar to Internet telephony, but it's optimized for transmitting fax data. IP faxing generally works by sending fax data over the Internet to strategically placed fax servers. Once a fax arrives at the server closest to its final destination, it's transferred onto normal telephone lines and transmitted like a normal fax. Because the data is transmitted over the Internet for most of its journey, the total cost of transmission is much less than if it traveled over long-distance telephone lines like conventional faxes.
There are many products that enable large companies to set up IP faxing servers at their own office locations. There are also national and international IP faxing services that allow companies and individuals to send faxes over their IP faxing networks for a fee.

IP_Masquerade
A Linux networking function. IP Masquerade, also called IPMASQ or MASQ, allows one or more computers in a network without assigned IP addresses to communicate with the Internet using the Linux server's assigned IP address. The IPMASQ server acts as a gateway, and the other devices are invisible behind it, so to other machines on the Internet the outgoing traffic appears to be coming from the IPMASQ server and not the internal PCs.  Since IPMASQ is a generic technology the server can be connected to other computers through LAN technologies like Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI, as well as dialup connections like PPP or SLIP.

IP_Multicast
Sending out data to distributed servers on the MBone (Multicast Backbone). For large amounts of data, IP Multicast is more efficient than normal Internet transmissions because the server can broadcast a message to many recipients simultaneously. Unlike traditional Internet traffic that requires separate connections for each source-destination pair, IP Multicasting allows many recipients to share the same source. This means that just one set of packets is transmitted for all the destinations. 

IP_Multimedia_Subsystem
The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is an IP multimedia and telephony core network that is defined by 3GPP and 3GPP2 standards and organizations based on IETF Internet protocols. IMS is access independent as it supports IP to IP session over wireline IP, 802.11, 802.15, CDMA, packet data along with GSM/EDGE/UMTS and other packet data applications. IMS is a standardized reference  architecture that consists of session control, connection control and an applications services framework along with subscriber and services data. ** [Adapted from  Lucent IP Multimedia Subsystem Overview]

IP_PBX
Short for Internet Protocol Private Branch eXchange, a telephone switch that supports VoIP. An IP PBX provides services similar to PBX services, but over data networks like a LAN or WAN rather than circuit-switched networks. IP PBX typically can switch calls between VoIP on local lines or between VoIP and traditional telephone users in the same way PBX does. IP PBX may also be seen abbreviated as IPPBX or IP/PBX.
 
See also Internet telephony and PBX.

IP_phone
A phone that sends traffic over a TCP/IP network. IP phones are typically used for VoIP applications.
See also Internet telephony.

IP_spoofing
(ī-pē spoof´ing) (n.) A technique used to gain unauthorized access to computers, whereby the intruder sends messages to a computer with an IP address indicating that the message is coming from a trusted host. To engage in IP spoofing, a hacker must first use a variety of techniques to find an IP address of a trusted host and then modify the packet headers so that it appears that the packets are coming from that host.
Newer routers and firewall arrangements can offer protection against IP spoofing.

IP_switching
(n.) A type of IP routing developed by Ipsilon Networks, Inc. Unlike conventional routers, IP switching routers use ATM hardware to speed packets through networks. Although the technology is new, it appears to be considerably faster than older router techniques. 

ip_telephone_system
An IP telephone system uses packet-switched Voice over IP (VoIP), or Internet telephony, to transmit telephone calls over the Internet as opposed to the circuit-switched telephony used by the traditional Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Also known as VoIP phone systems, IP telephone systems typically comprise a VoIP private branch exchange (an IP PBX) and desktop VoIP phones (IP Phones) that connect to a VoIP service provider via a Local Area Network (LAN).
One of the key advantages to IP telephone systems is that whereas long-distance calls on a regular phone system can be cost prohibitive, the same calls on an IP phone system are free -- there are no fees beyond the cost of Internet access.

ipad_app
A software application developed for use on Apple's original iPad device as well as later iPads like the iPad 2 and iPad 3. iPad apps are available through the Apple App Store and are designed to run on Apple's iOS mobile operating system, which powers the iPad as well as Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch devices. 
While many iPad apps will run on all iOS devices, there are also numerous native iPad apps that will only operate on these devices. Apple also encourages developers to program their own iPad apps for download through the App Store and has released an SDK with sample code projects to help developers get started.

ipad_hd
Apple's iPad HD is one of the speculated names, along with iPad 3, for the new third-generation iPad that debuted in March 2012 as simply "the new iPad."  The iPad HD retains the 9.7" size screen of the original iPad and iPad 2, but the device gets its nickname from a new ultra high definition Retina display with support for 2048-by-1536 resolution and 3.1 million pixels.

The iPad Mini also offers a 7.85-inch screen with 1024x768 resolution (as opposed to the iPad’s 9.7-inch Retina display screen), a dual-core A5 processor and 512MB of RAM, in a form factor that is 7.2 mm thick and weighs .68 lbs (53% lighter than the new iPad released earlier in the year).  The iPad Mini also offers 4G LTE support on both Verizon and AT&T networks in addition to Wi-Fi support.
Pricing for the iPad Mini begins at $329, and pre-orders for the tablet start on Friday, October 26th — the same day Windows 8 launches.

ipad_mini_2
A follow-up to 2012's original Apple iPad Mini that was officially announced on October 22, 2013, with availability scheduled for late November of the same year.
The second-generation iPad Mini, the "iPad Mini 2," is dubbed the iPad Mini with Retina Display by Apple, as it adds a 2048x1536-pixel resolution Retina Display as well as a 64-bit A7 processor to help handle the increased resolution.
The iPad Mini 2 also features iOS 7 as its mobile operating system, and pricing for it starts at $399, which is $70 higher than the starting price for the previous generation iPad Mini.

ipad-mini-3
The Apple iPad Mini 3 is the third generation of Apple's iPad Mini tablet computer and the successor to 2013's iPad Mini with Retina Display. The Apple iPad Mini 3 debuted in October 2014 at the same time as the iPad Air 2, which serves as the successor to the iPad Air.
The iPad Mini 3 retains the screen size and 2048x1536 resolution of the iPad Mini with Retina Display, which both offer a pixel density of 324ppi (pixels-per-inch) on a 7.9" display.
New Features in the iPad Mini 3
As far as new features, the main change in the iPad Mini 3 is the addition of a Touch ID fingerprint sensor like those found in newer iPhone 5 and 6 models. The only other changes are built-in support for the Apple iOS 8 mobile OS and a new gold color option, which joins the slate gray and white color options.

ipad-mini_with_retina_display
When Apple's iPad Mini debuted in late 2012, one of its few shortcomings according to critics was the lack of a crystal-clear Retina display like the displays used in newer versions of the iPhone and iPad. A new iPad Mini with Retina Display (aka the "iPad Mini 2") was announced by Apple on October 22, 2013, as an updated and upgraded version of the original iPad Mini.The iPad Mini with Retina Display increases the resolution from the original's 1024x768 to a resolution of 2048x1536, for a pixel density of 324ppi (pixels-per-inch) on a 7.9" display.

The iPad Pro is powered by Apple's iOS 9 mobile operating system and an A9X processor that Apple claims runs 22 times faster than the chip in the original iPad. Features include Force Touch support, a 1.2-megapixel FaceTime camera on the front and an 8-megapixel iSight camera on the back, enhanced multitasking support via iOS 9, 10 hours of battery life and multiple color options (silver, gold and space gray).

ipad-pro-rumors
The iPad Pro is a rumored new product from Apple that is expected to compete with tablet / laptop computer hybrid solutions like Microsoft's Surface Pro 3.  While there aren't many confirmed details about the iPad Pro at this point in time, analysts expect it to debut sometime in 2015 and feature a display size in the range of 12.2 to 12.9 inches while still offering a 7mm-thick form factor similar in depth to other iPads. The iPad Pro is also expected to include the same A8X processor featured in the 2014 iPad Air 2 release.
Expected Features on the iPad Pro
One expected feature in that iPad Pro that current iPads aren't able to offer is the ability to run two apps at once on the same screen in a split-screen multitasking faction, enabling capabilities such as viewing a web page while using FaceTime or watching a video while also working on a document or spreadsheet.

iPAQ
iPAQ is the name of the HP PDA. The iPAQ was initially introduced by Compaq, but after Hewlett Packard's acquisition of Compaq, the product has been marketed under the HP brand.

ipconfig
Ipconfig (sometimes written as IPCONFIG) is a command line tool used to control the network connections on Windows NT/2000/XP machines. There are three main commands: "all", "release", and "renew". Ipconfig displays all current TCP/IP network configuration values and refreshes Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS) settings. Used without parameters, ipconfig displays the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway for all adapters.

IPDS
Intelligent Printer Data Stream (IPDS) is the host-to-printer data stream used by  IBM's System Application Architecture (SAA) for Advanced Function Printing (AFP). The IPDS architecture defines the data stream used by print server programs and device drivers to manage all-points-addressable page printing on a full spectrum of devices from low-end workstation and local area network-attached (LAN-attached) printers to high-speed, high-volume page printers for production jobs, shared printing, and mailroom applications.

iPhone
An Internet-enabled smartphone developed by Apple. The iPhone combines mobile phone capabilities with a wireless Internet device and an iPod into one product. The iPhone also includes a 3.5-inch multi-touch screen (4-inch Retina Display on the iPhone 5), rather than a keyboard, that can be manipulated by users with by two finger touches. The iPhone runs on a special version of Apple's Mac OS X operating system.

iPhone_4S
Apple released an updated fourth generation of its hugely popular iPhone mobile smartphone in October 2011. The new phone, called the iPhone 4S, was widely expected to be the fifth-generation iPhone 5 prior to its release, but Apple instead chose to focus on the software and internal aspects of the phone instead of giving the new smartphone a new design or updated display.
Despite its look remaining the same, the iPhone 4S does include a number of impressive "under-the-hood" enhancements and new features, including a dual-core A5 chip (the same processor used in the iPad 2) for improved performance, a new Retina Display for a clearer display, an improved 8MP camera and optics, a video camera capable of recording in 1080p full HD, and support for the new iOS 5 operating system and Apple's iCloud service.
One of the most touted additions to the iPhone 4S is Siri, an "intelligent assistant" that enables users to use their voice to operate the phone and its applications.  With Siri users can use natural language voice commands to send messages, place calls, set reminders, operate iTunes and more.

iphone_5
The fifth generation of Apple's immensely popular iPhone mobile smartphone debuted in September 2012, supplanting the iPhone 4S as the company's latest, greatest smartphone device. While the iPhone 5 offers numerous "under-the-hood" enhancements, the most noticeable change over previous-generation iPhones is the iPhone 5's larger size (4" display vs. 3.5" in previous models), coupled with a thinner and lighter profile.  The iPhone 5's 4-inch Retina Display delivers a 1136x640 resolution, and other new additions include a faster A6 processor chip, improved wireless technology (including 4G LTE support), completely redesigned EarPod earbuds, an 8MP iSight camera (with a new Panorama mode) and support for the new iOS 6 operating system.
iOS 6 offers a number of enhancements of its own, including a completely redesigned Maps app that's no longer based on Google Maps and that now features turn-by-turn navigation, Passbook (a location-aware digital wallet app for storing things like tickets, gift cards, boarding passes, etc.), improved iCloud integration, the ability to use FaceTime on cellular connections, more sophisticated Siri capabilities, Facebook integration, AirPlay for wireless streaming of iPhone 5 content to an HDTV via Apple TV, Do Not Disturb call management tools and more.

iphone_5c
An improved version of Apple's iPhone 5 that debuted in September 2013 as the middle-tier smartphone in the iPhone lineup, which also includes the newly announced flagship iPhone 5S and the older iPhone 4S.  While the iPhone 5C looks similar to the iPhone5, it uses hard plastic housing rather than the aluminum casing found in previous iPhones, and it also comes in a choice of four bright colors (green, blue, pink, yellow) in addition to a white model.


iphone_5s
An improved version of Apple's iPhone 5 that adds a number of key new features while retaining the iPhone 5's 4-inch display.

iphone-6s
An improved version of Apple's iPhone 6 that made its debut in October 2015. The iPhone 6S and the iPhone 6S Plus add a variety of new features while retaining the same display and overall size as the iPhone 6 (4.7-inch display with 1334x750 resolution) and the iPhone 6 Plus (5.5-inch screen with 1920x1080 resolution).
The iPhone 6S runs on a new 64-bit A9 chip that offers up to 70 percent faster CPU performance and up to 90 percent faster GPU performance than the iPhone 6, according to Apple. Another key addition in the Apple iPhone 6S is a 3D Touch feature that utilizes Apple’s Taptic Engine to sense the amount of fingerprint pressure applied to the iPhone 6S display and reacts accordingly.
The iPhone 6S also adds iOS 9 as its mobile operating system, an improved 12-megapixel iSight camera with support for taking 4K video, and Wi-Fi and LTE performance enhancements. Pricing for the iPhone 6S remains unchanged from the iPhone 6.

iphone_app
A software application developed for use on Apple's iOS-powered iPhone devices.  iPhone apps are available through the Apple App Store and are designed to run on Apple's iOS mobile operating system, which powers the iPhone as well as Apple's iPad and iPod Touch devices. 
Apple encourages developers to program their own iPhone apps for download through the App Store, and the company has released an SDK with sample code projects to help developers get started.  iPhone apps in the App Store can be freely downloaded or purchased by users, with revenues for the latter shared between Apple (30%) and the software developer (70%).  Support for in-app purchases in iPhone apps offers developers an additional revenue option.

iPhone_Hacks
iPhone Hacks is used to describe any iPhone downloads, unlocks and tutorials that are intended to open the iPhone device to achieve what Apple "never intended", like connecting an external keyboard to the iPhone, record full-motion video, or remotely access your home network to control a desktop computer. Using the word Hacks is a misleading if you think the term means something illegal, as iPhone Hacks do conform to Apple's guidelines and doesn't risk breaking the warranty.    See also "iPhone Hacks Group Sees 3.0 Bonanza" on internetnews.com. See also "iPhone and iPhone 3G b . What's The Difference?" in Webopedia's Did You Know...? section.

iPhone_Killer
A buzzword that is used to describe any mobile phone that has the potential to be a threat to the Apple iPhone consumer market dominance. The Android platform is often referred to as an "iPhone Killer".  See also "iPhone and iPhone 3G b . What's The Difference?" in Webopedia's Did You Know...? section.

iphone_mobile_security

Mobile security applications for Apple's iOS mobile operating system help protect Apple iPhone smartphone and iPad tablet mobile devices from malware threats as well as unauthorized access following accidental loss or theft of the device.  Additional security features frequently offered by iPhone mobile security apps include scanning websites for potential phishing schemes or other fraudulent activity, storing passwords and other confidential information securely, VPN connectivity for protecting data in transit, helping users locate their device if lost or stolen, and more.


iPhone_SDK
A software development kit (SDK) released by Apple that allows people to write applications for both the iPhone and the iPod Touch. The iPhone SDK includes the Xcode IDE, Instruments, iPhone simulator, frameworks and samples, compilers, Shark analysis tool, and more. To download the iPhone SDK you must have an Apple ID. Developers have long insisted that by providing a development platform for iPhone is one way that Apple can work towards preventing people from hacking the operating system used by the device, which is a stripped down version of Apple's own OS X operating system.

IPIX
A technology developed by Interactive Pictures Corporation (formerly known as OmniView) that allows users to create and view 360-degree panoramic photographs. Originally called PhotoBubble, IPIX images are created by stitching together two hemispherical shots taken through a fish-eye lens. The result is a spherical panoramic image.  To view an IPIX, you need a stand-alone IPIX viewer or a plug-in that works within another application, such as a Web browser. The viewer allows you to move within the IPIX environment to view different parts of the image.  Interactive Pictures Corporation, which is also called IPIX, offers a variety of viewers and plug-ins for free, and sells tools to create and manipulate IPIX images. A competing format for panoramic images is QuickTime Virtual Reality (QTVR), developed by Apple Computer. 

IPL
Short for initial program load, the process of loading the operating system of a mainframe into the computer's main memory. IPL is the mainframe equivalent of booting or rebooting a personal computer.

IPMASQ
A Linux networking function. IP Masquerade, also called IPMASQ or MASQ, allows one or more computers in a network without assigned IP addresses to communicate with the Internet using the Linux server's assigned IP address. The IPMASQ server acts as a gateway, and the other devices are invisible behind it, so to other machines on the Internet the outgoing traffic appears to be coming from the IPMASQ server and not the internal PCs.  Since IPMASQ is a generic technology the server can be connected to other computers through LAN technologies like Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI, as well as dialup connections like PPP or SLIP.

IPng
IPv6 (Internet  Protocol Version 6) is also called IPng (Internet  Protocol next generation) and it  	is the newest version of the 	Internet Protocol (IP) reviewed in the IETF standards committees to replace the current version of IPv4 (Internet  Protocol Version 4).
The official name of IPng is IPv6, where IP stands for 	Internet Protocol and v6 stands for version 6.
Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) is the successor to Internet Protocol  	Version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 was designed as an evolutionary upgrade to the  	Internet Protocol and will, in fact, coexist with the older IPv4 for some  	time. IPv6 is designed to allow the Internet to grow steadily, both in terms  	of the number of hosts connected and the total amount of data traffic  	transmitted.

iPod
Apple's iPod is a small portable music player. Users can transfer songs to their iPod with their computer, iTunes, and the iPod software. Since the release of the Apple iPod in 2001, under the iPod brand Apple has released many variations of its product such as the iPod classic, iPod Touch, iPod Shuffle, iPod Mini, iPod Nano and several spin-off devices such as the iPod Photo.
See "iPod vs. MP3 Players: What's the Diff?"in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia.

ipod_touch
A mobile device from Apple that combines wireless Internet connectivity with the company's ubiquitous iPod music player functionality. The iPod touch shares many similarities with the Apple iPhone, with two major differences – the iPod touch lacks the iPhone's mobile phone capabilities, and it's significantly slimmer than the iPhone as a result.
Now in its fourth generation, the iPod touch also shares the same mobile operating system as the iPhone, Apple's iOS (currently in version iOS 5).  The iPod touch devices also feature support for Apple's free iCloud and iMessage services as well as all of the Apple App Store apps available for the iPhone.
Apple is expected to release a fifth generation of the iPod touch at some point in 2012, and the new device is expected to have features similar to the iPhone 5, including a larger screen and a faster processor. 

IPP
Short for Internet Printing Protocol, an Internet protocol that allows universal solutions to users trying to print documents from the Internet. The protocol allows the user to: find out about a printer's capabilities submit print jobs to a printer  find out the status of a printer or a print job  cancel a previously submitted print job   IPP will be transferred using the HTTP/1.1 protocol because HTTP/1.1 has the ability to perform multiple transfers over a single TCP connection and because it is the most widely accepted protocol in the Internet marketplace.  IPP was first drafted between Novell and Xerox with necessary support from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

IPS
(1) Short for  intrusion prevention system.
(2) Short for IP Storage, this technology is being standardized under the IP Storage (ips) IETF Working Group. Same as SoIP.

IPsec
Short for IP Security, a set of protocols developed by the IETF to support secure exchange of packets at the IP layer. IPsec has been deployed widely to implement Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
IPsec supports two encryption modes: Transport and Tunnel. Transport mode encrypts only the data portion (payload) of each packet, but leaves the header untouched. The more secure Tunnel mode encrypts both the header and the payload. On the receiving side, an IPSec-compliant device decrypts each packet.
For IPsec to work, the sending and receiving devices must share a public key. This is accomplished through a protocol known as Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol/Oakley (ISAKMP/Oakley), which allows the receiver to obtain a public key and authenticate the sender using digital certificates.

IPX
Short for Internetwork Packet Exchange, a networking protocol used by the Novell NetWare operating systems. Like UDP/IP, IPX is a datagram protocol used for connectionless communications. Higher-level protocols, such as SPX and NCP, are used for additional error recovery services. 

IRAP
Acronym for International Roaming Access Protocols. The International Roaming Access Protocols (IRAP) is a selection of methods for constructing  wireless infrastructures. * This is a set of proven, standards-based interfaces that establish a common baseline of features to facilitate seamless network interoperability. IRAP is an open framework, or profiles of a set of core protocols, for a unified, global network architecture. It is a set of architectural principles that make it easier for providers to build, test, and employ effective networks that provide secure and seamless global service. With IRAP, it is easier to enable people to stay connected in a variety of locations, on a variety of mobile devices.  IRAP is not intellectual property owned by any one company or organization (beyond that governed by the issuing standards body). * [Source:  Technology @ Intel magazine- International Roaming Access Protocols]

IRC
Short for Internet Relay Chat, a chat system developed by Jarkko Oikarinen in Finland in the late 1980s. IRC has become very popular as more people get connected to the Internetbecause it enables people connected anywhere on the Internet to join in live discussions. Unlike older chat systems, IRC is not limited to just two participants.
To join an IRC discussion, you need an IRC client  and Internet access. The IRC client is a program that runs on your computer and sends and receives messages to and from an IRC server. The IRC server, in turn, is responsible for making sure that all messages are broadcast to everyone participating in a discussion. There can be many discussions going on at once; each one is assigned a unique channel.


IrDA
Short for Infrared Data Association, a group of device manufacturers that developed a standard for transmitting data via infrared light waves. Increasingly, computers and other devices (such as printers) come with IrDA ports. This enables you to transfer data from one device to another without any cables. For example, if both your laptop computer and printer have IrDA ports, you can simply put your computer in front of the printer and output a document, without needing to connect the two with a cable.  IrDA ports support roughly the same transmission rates as traditional parallel ports. The only restrictions on their use is that the two devices must be within a few feet of each other and there must be a clear line of sight between them.  

IRG
Short for interrecord gap, the space between two consecutive physical blocks on a data recording medium, such as a hard drive or a magnetic tape. IRGs are used as markers for the end of data and also as safety margins for data overwrites.  An interrecord gap is also referred to as a interblock gap.

iris
On a digital camera iris is an adjustable aperture used to control the amount of light coming through the lens. The more the iris is opened, the more light it lets in and the brighter the scene will be. Camcorders may also have an iris that works in the the same way as one on a digital camera. However, as you adjust the iris you see the brightness change in the viewfinder.

iris_recognition
In biometrics is is a type of physical identification that is based on the personal and unique characteristics of the iris -- the colored ring around the pupil of an eye. Similar to the more common fingerprint recognition, iris recognition is based on scanning a person's iris and comparing the scan to a stored photograph or template to make an identification match

IRMA_board
A popular expansion board for PCs and Macintoshes that enables these personal computers to emulate IBM 3278 and 3279 mainframe terminals. In other words, personal computers with IRMA boards can function as both stand-alone computers and as terminals connected to a mainframe computer. IRMA boards are made by a company called DCA.  

IRPStackSize
In Microsoft operating systems including Windows NT, Windows 2000 Server, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, the IRPStackSize is a parameter that specifies the number of stack locations in I/O request packets (IRPs) that are used by the operating system. Each stack uses 36 bytes of memory for each receive buffer and you can increase the IRPStackSize, through the Windows registry for some transports, media access control (MAC) drivers, or for file system drivers. The default value of the IRPStackSize parameter is 15.

IRQ
Abbreviation of interrupt request line, and pronounced I-R-Q. IRQs are hardware lines over which devices can send interrupt signals to the microprocessor. When you add a new device to a PC, you sometimes need to set its IRQ number by setting a DIP switch. This specifies which interrupt line the device may use. IRQ conflicts used to be a common problem when adding expansion boards, but the Plug-and-Play specification has removed this headache in most cases.
Also see the list of IRQ numbers in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

IRTF
Short for the Internet Research Task Force, an organization that forms research groups to explore developments in Internet protocols, applications, architecture and other technology. The organization is chartered by the Internet Architecture Board.

IS
Pronounced as separate letters, and short for Information Systems or Information Services. For many companies, IS is the name of the department responsible for computers, networking and data management. Other companies refer to the department as IT (Information Technology) and MIS (Management Information Services).
Information systems support different types of decisions at different levels of the organizational hierarchy. Major types of Information systems include structural databases and information management software that can include the following;

Transaction Process Systems (TPS)
Enterprise Collaboration Systems (ECS)
Management Information Systems (MIS)
Decision Support Systems (DSS)
Executive Support Systems (ESS)



information_systems_manager
Information systems managers (IS Manager) implement information technology in an organization, overseeing a team of IT professionals. The role encompasses information systems planning, installation, and maintenance, including hardware and software upgrades. IS managers may focus on a specific issue such as network security or Internet services, or they may coordinate all technology operations.


IS_95
Short for Interim Standard 95, IS-95 is a version of CDMA specified by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and is used by digital cellular networks in North America, Korea and Japan. It uses frequency ranges around 800MHz and 1900MHz and can be upgraded to the CDMA2000 standard. IS-95 is also called cdmaOne.

IS_IS
Intermediate System-Intermediate System is an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) hierarchical routing protocol where IS routers exchange routing information based on a single metric to determine network topology.  IS-IS is often used in IP networks.

ISA_bus
(Pronounced as separate letters or as eye-sa). Short for Industry Standard Architecture bus, the bus architecture used in the IBM PC/XT and PC/AT. The AT version of the bus is called the AT bus and became a de facto industry standard. Starting in the early 90s, ISA began to be replaced by the PCI local bus architecture. Most computers made today include both an AT bus for slower devices and a PCI bus for devices that need better bus performance.  In 1993, Intel and Microsoft introduced a new version of the ISA specification called Plug and Play ISA. Plug and Play ISA enables the operating system to configure expansion boards automatically so that users do not need to fiddle with DIP switches and jumpers. 

ISA_bus
(Pronounced as separate letters or as eye-sa). Short for Industry Standard Architecture bus, the bus architecture used in the IBM PC/XT and PC/AT. The AT version of the bus is called the AT bus and became a de facto industry standard. Starting in the early 90s, ISA began to be replaced by the PCI local bus architecture. Most computers made today include both an AT bus for slower devices and a PCI bus for devices that need better bus performance.  In 1993, Intel and Microsoft introduced a new version of the ISA specification called Plug and Play ISA. Plug and Play ISA enables the operating system to configure expansion boards automatically so that users do not need to fiddle with DIP switches and jumpers. 

iSAC
Global IP Solutions (GIPS iSAC) is a proprietary wideband codec used in high and low-bit-rate VoIP communications. GIPS iSAC is designed to offer better than PSTN quality at dial-up modem data rates. Since the codec automatically adjusts transmission rates from a low of 10 kbps to a maximum of 32 kbps it is also well-suited to VoIP with wideband quality applications. iSAC is part of the GIPS MediaWare voice processing software suite.

ISAM
Abbreviation for Indexed Sequential Access Method, a method for managing how a computer accesses records and files stored on a hard disk. While storing data sequentially, ISAM provides direct access to specific records through an index. This combination results in quick data access regardless of whether records are being accessed sequentially or randomly.  There are a number of products that provide basic ISAM access for different operating systems and program languages.   

ISAPI
Short for Internet Server API, an API for Microsoft's IIS (Internet Information Server) Web server. ISAPI enables programmers to develop Web-based applications that run much faster than conventional CGI programs because they're more tightly integrated with the Web server. In addition to IIS, several Web servers from companies other than Microsoft support ISAPI. 

iSCSI
Pronounced eye skuzzy. Short for Internet SCSI, an IP-based standard for linking data storage devices over a network and transferring data by carrying SCSI commands over IP networks. iSCSI supports a Gigabit Ethernet interface at the physical layer, which allows systems supporting iSCSI interfaces to connect directly to standard Gigabit Ethernet switches and/or IP routers. When an operating system receives a request it generates the SCSI command and then sends an IP packet over an Ethernet connection. At the receiving end, the SCSI commands are separated from the request, and the SCSI commands and data are sent to the SCSI controller and then to the SCSI storage device. iSCSI will also return a response to the request using the same protocol.  iSCSI is important to SAN technology because it enables a SAN to be deployed in a LAN, WAN or MAN.  iSCSI was developed by the IETF and became an official standard in February 2003.

ISDN
Abbreviation of integrated services digital network, an international communications standard for sending voice, video, and data over digital telephone lines or normal telephone wires. ISDN supports data transfer rates of 64 Kbps (64,000 bits per second).
There are two types of ISDN:

Basic Rate Interface (BRI) -- consists of two 64-Kbps B-channels and one D-channelfor transmitting control information.
Primary Rate Interface (PRI) -- consists of 23 B-channels and one D-channel (U.S.) or 30 B-channels and one D-channel (Europe).

The original version of ISDN employs baseband transmission. Another version, called B-ISDN, uses broadband transmission and is able to support transmission rates of 1.5 Mbps. B-ISDN requires fiber opticcables and is not widely available.

ISMA
Short for the Internet Streaming Media Alliance, a non-profit organization that furthers the specification of interoperability standards for streaming rich media over IP networks. According to the ISMA Web site, by "defining an interoperable approach for creating, transporting and viewing streaming media, content creators, product developers and service providers will have easier access to the expanding commercial and consumer markets for streaming media services."

ISO
(1)  Short for International Organization for Standardization. Note that ISO is not an acronym; instead, the name derives from the greek word iso, which means equal. Founded in 1946, ISO is an international organization composed of national standards bodies from over 75 countries. For example, ANSI (American National Standards Institute) is a member of ISO. ISO has defined a number of important computer standards, the most significant of which is perhaps OSI (Open Systems Interconnection), a standardized architecture for designing networks.
(2) See ISO image.


ISO_9000
A family of standards approved by the International Standards Organization (ISO)  that define a quality assurance program. Companies that conform to these standards can receive ISO 9000 certification. This doesn't necessarily mean that the company's products have a high quality; only that the company follows well-defined procedures for ensuring quality products. Increasingly, software buyers are requiring ISO 9000 certification from their suppliers.  

ISO_image
ISO image is a term commonly associated with CD and DVD burning.  An ISO image (or .ISO file) is a computer file that is an exact copy of an existing file system.  An ISO can contain the entire contents of a CD-ROM disc or CD medium. ISO files are typically created through a software application that will open, create, edit, and extract CD or DVD image files, then convert the extracted image to an ISO file, easily allowing users to burn an exact copy of the original onto CD or DVD.

ISO_Latin_1
Officially named ISO-8859-1, a standard character set developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). ISO Latin-1 is a superset of the ASCII character set and is very similar to the ANSI character set used in Windows, though the two are not identical. Both the HTTP and HTML protocols used on the World Wide Web are based on ISO Latin-1. This means that to represent non-ASCII characters on a Web page, you need to use the corresponding ISO Latin-1 code.  

isochronous
Time-dependent. Pronounced eye-sock-ra-nuss, it refers to processes where data must be delivered within certain time constraints. For example, multimedia streams require an isochronous transport mechanism to ensure that data is delivered as fast as it is displayed and to ensure that the audio is synchronized with the video.  Isochronous can be contrasted with asynchronous, which refers to processes in which data streams can be broken by random intervals, and synchronous processes, in which data streams can be delivered only at specific intervals. Isochronous service is not as rigid as synchronous service, but not as lenient as asynchronous service.  Certain types of networks, such as ATM, are said to be isochronous because they can guarantee a specified throughput. Likewise, new bus architectures, such as IEEE 1394, support isochronous delivery.  

ISP
Short for Internet Service Provider, it refers to a company that provides Internet services, including personal and business access to the Internet. For a monthly fee, the service provider usually provides a software package, username, password and access phone number. Equipped with a modem, you can then log on to the Internet and browse the World Wide Web and USENET, and send and receive e-mail. For broadband access you typically receive the broadband modem hardware or pay a monthly fee for this equipment that is added to your ISP account billing.
In addition to serving individuals, ISPs also serve large companies, providing a direct connection from the company's networks to the Internet. ISPs themselves are connected to one another through Network Access Points (NAPs). ISPs may also be called IAPs (Internet Access Providers).

ISV
Short for Independent Software Vendor, a company that produces software. 

ISWC
Short for International Standard Works Code, an internationally recognized reference number for the identification of musical works. The code that is applied to a musical work is permanent and stays with the work even when it is transferred across national borders. An ISWC begins with the letter "T", followed by a nine-digit unique number (from 00000001 to 999999999), and an additional check digit at the end.  The ISWC is an ISO-approved standard. The International ISWC Agency, which is appointed by ISO, is responsible for the overall ISWC system maintenance and administration.

IT
IT is short for  Information Technology and is pronounced as separate letters.
IT (information technology) is the broad subject concerned with all aspects of managing and processing information, especially within a large organization or company. IT is generally not used in reference to personal or home computing and networking.
IT: More Than Computers and Networks
While IT is often used to describe computers and computer networks, it actually  includes all layers of all systems within an organization -- from the physical hardware to the operating systems, applications, databases, storage, servers and more. Telecommunication technologies, including Internet and business phones are also part of an organization's IT infrastructure.

it_business_liaison
An IT business liaison is a person in a job role that represents IT (information technology) to the business. The IT business liaison is primarily responsible for the strategic implementation of new technology solutions that improve business efficiency while meeting corporate business goals. 
Liaisons understand business strategy and can identify technologies that will improve and enhance an organization's business goals.
The IT business liaison is a support role and this person is often the single point of contact between an organization's IT and business teams.  Organizations typically invest in an IT business liaison to improve communication and collaboration between the  IT department and its business divisions but also to ensure all departments are aligned to meet overall business goals.

IT_Capability_Maturity_Framework
Abbreviated as IT-CMF, the IT Capability Maturity Framework was launched by The Innovation Value Institute (IVI) to provide a concise management roadmap to optimize business value derived from IT investments. This framework has been proven to deliver greater business value from IT while reducing the complexity of IT choices for CIOs. The IT-CMF consists of a five-stage maturity model used to organize and structure a framework for mapping IT improvement efforts. The holistic approach of the IT-CMF is reflected by its four foundational macro processes:  Managing IT like a Business: shifting the focus from technology and production to a focus on customers and services Managing the IT Budget: investing in innovative IT solutions that deliver better value and performance Managing the IT Capability: managing IT assets throughout the value chain and developing core competencies  Managing IT for Business Value: linking IT investments to overall business benefits  In total, the IT-CMF identifies 36 core processes and categorizes them under these four dimensions to cover all activities in an IT department. An assessment of an IT organization's maturity across these 36 processes, together with comparisons to industry benchmarks and best practices, will highlight the company's key maturity gaps and value-creation opportunities. See also "New Framework Designed to Optimize IT Value" on CIO Update for a better understanding of the term.

it_network_administrator
The IT network administrator focuses on maintaining an organization's data management network. The IT network extends to the corporate LAN, WAN, intranet, and Internet. Users rely on this web of networking technology to communicate and share, store, and process information. IT network administrators are responsible for maintaining a reliable, secure, and efficient data communications network.


it_network_engineer
An IT network engineer designs the computer networks that organizations rely on to access, share, and store information. Network engineers implement and maintain local area networks (LAN), wide area networks (WAN), the corporate intranet and Internet connections, and the virtual private network (VPN). The complexity of the work depends on the organization: a small start up may employ a computer engineer to oversee a handful of desktop computers, while an engineer at a large multinational manages a web of complex, globally distributed networks.
A bachelor's degree is the minimum qualification for an IT network engineer career, though many engineers secure this advanced role with a master's degree in computer science or MBA in information systems. IT certifications such as Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert (CCIE) and Cisco Certified Architect (CCAr) offer a means of keeping pace with evolving network technology.

IT_outsourcing
 IT outsourcing is a phrase used to describe the practice of seeking resources -- or subcontracting -- outside of an organizational structure for all or part of an IT (Information Technology) function. An organization would use IT outsourcing for functions ranging from infrastructure to software development, maintenance and support. For example, an enterprise might outsource its IT management because it is cheaper to contract a third party to do so than it would be to build its own in-house IT management team. Or a company might outsource all of its data storage needs because it does not want to buy and maintain its own data storage devices. Most large organizations only outsource a portion of any given IT function.

it_program_manager
The IT program manager oversees a team of information systems professionals who are engaged in various projects. Program managers differ from project managers in that their roles are broader in scope. While a project manager focuses on a particular initiative, for example, the program manager manages a range of initiatives to achieve a particular organizational outcome. The program manager's role requires a degree of technical knowledge, but emphasizes business management skill.
A bachelor's degree in management information systems or computer science offers a starting point on the road to a career as an IT program manager. An MBA degree in information technology management is generally required to advance into a management role. Program managers can expect increasing demand for their combined business and technical acumen. The Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts "excellent" job prospects for information systems managers, with 17 percent growth in the 2008-2018 period.

IT_CMF
Abbreviated as IT-CMF, the IT Capability Maturity Framework was launched by The Innovation Value Institute (IVI) to provide a concise management roadmap to optimize business value derived from IT investments. This framework has been proven to deliver greater business value from IT while reducing the complexity of IT choices for CIOs. The IT-CMF consists of a five-stage maturity model used to organize and structure a framework for mapping IT improvement efforts. The holistic approach of the IT-CMF is reflected by its four foundational macro processes:  Managing IT like a Business: shifting the focus from technology and production to a focus on customers and services Managing the IT Budget: investing in innovative IT solutions that deliver better value and performance Managing the IT Capability: managing IT assets throughout the value chain and developing core competencies  Managing IT for Business Value: linking IT investments to overall business benefits  In total, the IT-CMF identifies 36 core processes and categorizes them under these four dimensions to cover all activities in an IT department. An assessment of an IT organization's maturity across these 36 processes, together with comparisons to industry benchmarks and best practices, will highlight the company's key maturity gaps and value-creation opportunities. See also "New Framework Designed to Optimize IT Value" on CIO Update for a better understanding of the term.

Itanium
 A member of Intel's new Merced family of processors, Itanium is a 64-bit RISC microprocessor. Based on the EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing) design philosophy, which states that the compiler should decide which instructions be executed together, Itanium has the highest FPU power available.   In 64-bit mode, Itanium is able to calculate two bundles of a maximum of three instructions at a time. In 32-bit mode, it is much slower. Decoders must first translate 32-bit instruction sets into 64-bit instruction sets, which results in extra-clock cycle use.   Itanium's primary use is driving large applications that require more than 4 GB of memory, such as databases, ERP, and future Internet applications. 

iteration
A single pass through a group of instructions. Most programs contain loops of instructions that are executed over and over again. The computer iterates through the loop, which means that it repeatedly executes the loop.  

ITIL
Short for IT Infrastructure Library, an infrastructure library developed in the UK. ITIL is a widely accepted approach to IT service management in the world. ITIL provides a cohesive set of best practice, drawn from the public and private sectors internationally.

Ivy Bridge processors are fabricated on a 22nm (nanometer) die shrink as opposed to Sandy Bridge's 32nm process technology, and Ivy Bridge processors are backward compatible with the Sandy Bridge platform, enabling the chips to use the same motherboards as Sandy Bridge processors.
Among the many new features in Ivy Bridge processors are Intel's new Tri-Gate transistor technology, PCI Express 3.0 support, USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt support, and Graphics Direc X 11 and Open CL 1.1 support.  Collectively, these new features and process technology are expected to offer improved performance over Sandy Bridge in the range of 20% for CPU performance and 30% or more for on-board graphics performance.

iWarp
The iWarp project was started in 1988 to investigate issues involved in building and using high performance computer systems with powerful communication support. It is an experimental parallel system based on the idea of integrating a VLIW processor and a sophisticated fine-grained communication system on a single chip. iWarp was designed and built jointly by Carnegie Mellon University and Intel Corporation. The high speed static memory and the high performance low latency communication system make iWarp a very well suited target for research efforts and many "proof of concept" applications. Intel Corporation announced the iWarp systems as product in 1989 and built iWarp systems with over 1500 nodes since then. With the creation of the Intel Supercomputing Systems Division (iPSC) in 1992 the iWarp was merged with the iPSC product line. Intel kept iWarp as a product but stopped actively marketing it. Today they are no longer made.
