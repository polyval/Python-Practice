yacy

YaCy (pronounced as "ya see") is a free and open source (GPL-licensed) distributed search engine. Using principles of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, it is fully decentralized. That means all users of the search engine network are equal, and the network does not store user search requests, which makes it impossible for anyone to censor the content of the shared index.
YaCy also helps to prevent spam in search results by performing link verification as part of the search process.

Year_2000_problem

The pervasive problem that many applications are designed to handle only 20th-century dates -- dates that begin with "19". For example, most programs represent dates in the form MM-DD-YY, so the date 10-5-96 is October 5, 1996. But what about the date 10-5-05. Is that 1905 or 2005? There is no way to distinguish between these two dates.  This problem affects a vast amount of software, particularly accounting and database systems. The U.S. Social Security Administration, for example, has estimated that it will need to review about 50 million lines of code to correct this problem in its own system.  The Year 2000 problem is sometimes referred to as the Millennium bug or Y2K problem.
