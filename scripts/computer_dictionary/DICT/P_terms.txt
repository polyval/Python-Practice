project_coordinator
The project coordinator works across groups, aligning internal team members and external stakeholders. IT project coordinators may coordinate project phases and schedules, arrange support services, order supplies, and track progress. The coordinator typically reports to the project manager and serves as a department liaison to product developers and marketing executives.
IT project coordination brings together business administration expertise and a background in information technology. Most IT project coordinators get their start with a computer science degree or information technology certification. A bachelor's degree in management information systems (MIS), for example, offers a combined business and technology education. Coordinators can advance into project management with Project Management Professional (PMP) certification or an MBA.

P_CAV
Acronym for Partial-Constant Angular Velocity, also called partial CAV, P-CAV a method of writing data to CD-R and CD-RW media. Using artial-Constant Angular Velocity means that when data is recorded to the inner part of the CD, the disc rotates at a constant speed but the data is delivered at a a variable speed. On the outer portion of the CD, the data is recorded at a constant rate but the speed at which the disc turns varies.

P_frame
Short for predictive frame, or predicted frame, a video compression method used by the MPEG standard. In a motion sequence, individual frames of pictures are grouped together (called a group of pictures, or GOP) and played back so that the viewer registers the video��s spatial motion. P-frames follow I-frames and contain only the data that have changed from the preceding I-frame (such as color or content changes). Because of this, P-frames depend on the I-frames to fill in most of the data.  P-frames and B-frames are also referred to as delta frames.  Also see I-frame and B-frame.

p2mp
Short for Point-to-Multipoint, it is typically used in wireless Internet and IP telephony networks.  Point-to-Multipoint is a communications network that provides a path from one location to multiple locations.

P2T
Push-to-talk (or press-to-talk) is a two-way communication method that uses half-duplex mode where transmission occurs in both directions, but not at the same time. To use PTT, users must press a button on the PTT device while speaking, then release it when done. The listener must then do the same to respond. Common PTT devices include the walkie-talkie. Newer PTT systems use VoIP to provide digital PTT service over 3G data networks. Synonymous with press-to-talk. 
In PC and mobile voice chat applications, push-to-talk is a software feature that requires the speaker to press a button to enable voice speaking. This prevents background noises and talking from sending during the chat session.
Push-to-talk may be abbreviated as PTT or P2T.See also Push-to-talk Over Cellular.

P3P
Platform for Privacy Preferences is a specification that will allow users' Web browsers to automatically understand Web sites' privacy practices. Privacy policies will be embedded in the code of a Web site. Browsers will read the policy, and then, automatically provide certain information to specific sites based on the preferences set by the users. For instance, if the site is an e-commerce site, the browser will automatically provide shipping info. If the site is requesting demographic info, then the browser will know to provide it anonymously.   The P3P specification was developed by the W3C P3P Syntax, Harmonization, and Protocol Working Groups, including W3C Member organizations and experts in the field of Web privacy. P3P is based on W3C specifications that have already been established, including HTTP, XML and Resource Description Framework (RDF). 

PA_DSS
Short for Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA-DSS) it is a best practices standard maintained by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) to assist software and other third-party vendors to develop secure payment applications that support compliance with the PCI-DSS.

PaaS
Short for Platform as a Service, PaaS is defined as a computing platform being delivered as a service. Here the platform is outsourced  in place of a company or data center purchasing and managing their own hardware and software layers. Typically, PaaS facilitates deployment of applications, application development, testing, and also supports the building, testing and hosting of Web applications. PaaS enables IT to develop, test, deploy, host, and also update from a single streamlined environment. May also be referred to as cloudware. Sun Microsystems identifies Platform as a Service (PaaS)as one of three layers of cloud computing, in addition to Software as a Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

PABX
Short for Private Automated Branch Exchange, this telephone network is commonly used by call centers and other organizations. PABX allows a single access number to offer multiple lines to outside callers while providing a range of external lines to internal callers or staff.
See also BPX.

packed_file
A file in a compressed format. Many operating systems and applications contain commands that enable you to pack a file so that it takes up less memory. For example, suppose you have a text file containing ten consecutive space characters. Normally, this would require ten bytes of storage. However, a program that packs files would replace the space characters by a special space-series character followed by the number of spaces being replaced. In this case, the ten spaces would require only two bytes. This is just one packing technique -- there are many others. One disadvantage of packed files, however, is that they can be read only by the program that packed them because they contain special codes.  Some modems automatically pack data before transmitting it across communications lines. This can produce faster communication because fewer bytes need to be sent. However, the modem on the receiving side must be capable of unpacking the data.  Packing is often referred to as data compression, particularly when it involves data communications.  

packet
(pak´it) (n.) A piece of a message transmitted over a packet-switching network. See under packet switching. One of the key features of a packet is that it contains the destination address in addition to the data. In IP networks, packets are often called datagrams.


packet_buffer
(pak´et buf´&r) (n.) Memory space that is set aside specifically for either storing a packet that is awaiting transmission over a network or storing a packet that has been received over a network. The memory space is either located in the network interface card or in the computer that holds the card.

packet_collision
In a network, when two or more stations attempt to transmit a packet across the network at the same time, a packet collision occurs. This is not uncommon in a shared medium such as an Ethernet that has many computers in the same network segment. When a packet collision occurs, the packets are either discarded or sent back to their originating stations and then retransmitted in a timed sequence to avoid further collision. Packet collisions can result in the loss of packet integrity or can impede the performance of a network. Also see CSMA/CD.

packet_collision_rate
The amount of packet collisions that occur in a network in a specified time period, usually one minute. The packet collision rate is typically monitored by the router.

packet_filtering
Also referred to as static packet filtering. Controlling access to a network by analyzing the incoming and outgoing packets and letting them pass or halting them based on the IP addresses of the source and destination. Packet filtering is one technique, among many, for implementing security firewalls.  Compare with stateful inspection.

packet_switching
Refers to protocols in which messages are divided into packets before they are sent. Each packet is then transmitted individually and can even follow different routes to its destination. Once all the packets forming a message arrive at the destination, they are recompiled into the original message.
Most modern Wide Area Network (WAN)  protocols, including TCP/IP, X.25, and Frame Relay, are based on packet-switching technologies. In contrast, normal telephone service is based on a circuit-switching technology, in which a dedicated line is allocated for transmission between two parties. Circuit-switching is ideal when data must be transmitted quickly and must arrive in the same order in which it's sent. This is the case with most real-time data, such as live audio and video. Packet switching is more efficient and robust for data that can withstand some delays in transmission, such as e-mail messages and Web pages.
A new technology, ATM, attempts to combine the best of both worlds -- the guaranteed delivery of circuit-switched networks and the robustness and efficiency of packet-switching networks.

PAD
Short for packet assembler/disassembler PAD is a device (hardware or software) used in  packet switching to enable data terminal equipment (DTE) not equipped for packet switching to access a packet-switched network. PAD is a term most often associated with an X.25 network where the PAD breaks the data stream into individual packets and formats the packet headers for asynchronous transmission.

pad_character
A character used to fill empty space. Many applications have fields that must be a particular length. For example, in a database application, you may have a field that is ten characters in length. If you use only four of the allotted characters, the program itself must fill in the remaining six characters with pad characters.  Some applications allow you to choose the character to be used as padding.  

pad_printed_keycap
(pad print´&d kē´kap) (n.) A keycap on a keyboard that has had its legend printed in ink and is subsequently protected with a protective layer that typically is baked onto the keyboard. The legends on pad-printed keyboards typically are printed all at one time onto a fully manufactured keyboard.  Pad printing is a common method of imprinting notebook computer keyboards that use light-colored legends on top of dark keys. The printed keyboard is baked before it is installed on the notebook.

padding
Filling in unused space.  

PaDSL
Acronym for "Private Access DSL". PaDSL is a solution for creating secure private broadband VPNs (virtual private network). PaDSL is a cost-effective alternative to traditional frame relay, leased line and ISDN WAN networks. It is most useful to business or organizations who wants to use DSL as an access technology for WAN//VPN objectives without the inherent risk of using the public Internet as the access medium. The first PaDSL service was launched in the UK by THUS plc.

page
(pāj) (n.) (1) A fixed amount of data.  (2) In word processing, a page of text. Most text-processing applications recognize a hierarchy of components, starting with a character at the lowest level, followed by a word, a line, a paragraph, and a page. Applications permit certain operations for each type of component; for example, you can delete a character, a word, a line, and sometimes an entire page. For pages, you can also specify formatting characteristics (for example, page size, margins, and number of columns).  (3) In virtual memory systems, a page is a fixed number of bytes recognized by the operating system.  (4) Short for Web page.  (v.) (1) To display one page (or screenful) of a document at a time. To contrast, see scroll.  (2) To copy a page of data from main memory to a mass storage device, or vice versa. Paging is one form of swapping.    

page_break
The end of a page of text. In word-processing systems, you can enter special codes, called hard page breaks or forced page breaks, that cause the printer to advance to the next page. Without hard page breaks, the word processor automatically begins a new page after a page has been filled (this depends on the number of lines per page). In this case, the page break is called a soft  page break.     

page_Description_Language_PDL
Abbreviated as PDL, a language for describing the layout and contents of a printed page. The best-known PDLs are Adobe PostScript and Hewlett-Packard PCL (Printer Control Language), both of which are used to control laser printers.
Both PostScript and modern versions of PCL are object-oriented, meaning that they describe a page in terms of geometrical objects such as lines, arcs, and circles.
 

Page_Down_key
Often abbreviated PgDn, the Page Down key is standard on PC and Macintosh keyboards. Its meaning differs from one program to another, but it usually moves the cursor down a set number of lines. 

page_fault
An interrupt that occurs when a program requests data that is not currently in real memory. The interrupt triggers the operating system to fetch the data from a virtual memory and load it into RAM.  An invalid page fault or page fault error occurs when the operating system cannot find the data in virtual memory. This usually happens when the virtual memory area, or the table that maps virtual addresses to real addresses, becomes corrupt. 

page_impression
The exact number of times a specific Web site has been accessed or viewed by a user. A page impression acts as a counter for Web pages, informing site owners how many times their sites were visited. Page impressions are also referred to as hits.

page_layout_program
A program that enables you to format pages of text and graphics. Many word-processing systems support their own page layout functions, but page layout applications designed specifically for this purpose generally give you more control over fine points such as text flow, kerning, and positioning of graphics.   

page_per_minute
PPM or Page Per Minute, is a common method of measuring the output of a printer, as it determines the speed a printer is capable of printing. PPM between different printers cannot be compared on a one-to-one ratio, as you can expect a different PPM number between different types of printers (lasers or inkjets) as well as different PPM numbers between color and black & white print jobs, and the resolution of the image or text being printed. Most printer manufactures will specify the maximum page per minute you can expect to achieve with a specific printer model.

page_printer
Any printer that processes an entire page at one time. All laser and ink-jet printers are page printers, which means that they must have enough memory to store at least one page.  

page_template
A page template, or Web page template, often refers to a predesigned Web page that you can customize. The page template would include font, style, formatting, tables, graphics and other elements commonly found on a Web page. Using a Web authoring program, you can open the page template and easily customize the template to meet your needs.

Page_Up_key
Often abbreviated PgUp, the Page Up key is standard on PC and Macintosh keyboards. Its meaning differs from one program to another, but it usually scrolls the document up one screenful. 

page_view
A Web page that has been viewed by one visitor. Page views are often used in online advertising, where advertisers use the number of page views a site receives to determine where and how to advertise.  Compare with page hit.

page_white_display
A special type of LCD display screen that uses supertwist technology to produce a high contrast between the foreground and background.  

pagejacking
The activity of stealing content (typically in the form of source code) from a Web site and copying it into another Web site in order to siphon some of the original site��s traffic to the copied Web pages. Pagejackers rely on search engines to spider the contents of the illegitimate site and index the results so that the copied site will appear in the search result rankings along with the original site��s rankings. Users can be tricked into thinking the illegitimate site is the one they are searching for, and once they visit the copied site they may be subjected to mousetrapping.  The term pagejacking is a combination of the words Web page and hijacking, indicating that a Web page has been hijacked.  Also see How Web Search Engines Work in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia.

pagination
(1) Refers to numbering pages in a document.  (2) Refers to dividing a document into pages. Most word processors automatically paginate documents based on a page size that you specify. Some word processors enable you to avoid widows and orphans during pagination.  

paging
)A technique used by virtual memory operating systems to help ensure that the data you need is available as quickly as possible. The operating system copies a certain number of pages from your storage device to main memory. When a program needs a page that is not in main memory, the operating system copies the required page into memory and copies another page back to the disk. One says that the operating system pages the data. Each time a page is needed that is not currently in memory, a page fault occurs. An invalid page fault occurs when the address of the page being requested is invalid. In this case, the application is usually aborted.
This type of virtual memory is called paged virtual memory. Another form of virtual memory is segmented virtual memory.


paid_inclusion
(pād in-kloo´zh&n) (n.) Paid inclusion is a search engine marketing model in which a website pays a fee to a search engine that guarantees that the site will be displayed in the returned search results for specifically named search terms.For example, a Web site that sells baseball trading cards can pay a search engine to ensure that its site is returned in the search results when a user searches on the phrase "vintage baseball cards."
Paid inclusion, for some search engines, also means that the search engine's spiders will crawl their sites more often than non-paid sites. Different search engines treat paid inclusion results differently; some indicate the paid inclusion results as advertisements while others display them as results alongside non-paid search results.

paid_search
A type of contextual advertising where Web site owners pay an advertising fee, usually based on click-throughs or ad views to have their Web site search results shown in top placement on search engine result pages. Some search engines will make it easy for users to determine which search results are natural and which are paid, while others will mix the results making it more difficult for users to determine which are the paid search results. Also called sponsored search.

paint_program
A graphics  program that enables you to draw pictures on the display screen which are represented as bit maps (bit-mapped graphics). In contrast, draw programs use vector graphics (object-oriented images), which scale better.  Most paint programs provide the tools shown below in the form of icons. By selecting an icon, you can perform functions associated with the tool.  In addition to these tools, paint programs also provide easy ways to draw common shapes such as straight lines, rectangles, circles, and ovals.  Sophisticated paint applications are often called image editing programs. These applications support many of the features of draw programs, such as the ability to work with objects. Each object, however, is represented as a bit map rather than as a vector image.  

painting_tool
In graphics and image-editing programs the painting tool changes the area of your image where you use the cursor to add paint strokes to the image. You can use this tool to do tasks such as fill in single pixels, add hard or soft lines, or select areas to fill with a solid color. Some programs will allow you to paint with a texture rather than a single color.  See also "Graphics Software Terminology" in the  Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

PAL
(1) Short for Phase Alternating Line, the dominant television standard in Europe. The United States uses a different standard, NTSC. Whereas NTSC delivers 525 lines of resolution at 60 half-frames per second, PAL delivers 625 lines at 50 half-frames per second. Many video adapters that enable computer monitors to be used as television screens support both NTSC and PAL signals.  (2) Short for Programmable Array Logic, a type of Programmable Logic Device (PLD). 

palette
(1) In computer graphics, a palette is the set of available colors. For a given application, the palette may be only a subset of all the colors that can be physically displayed. For example, a SVGA system can display 16 million unique colors, but a given program would use only 256 of them at a time if the display is in 256-color mode. The computer system's palette, therefore, would consist of the 16 million colors, but the program's palette would contain only the 256-color subset.  A palette is also called a CLUT (color look-up table).  On monochrome systems, the term palette is sometimes used to refer to the available fill patterns.  (2) In paint and illustration programs, a palette is a collection of symbols that represent drawing tools. For example, a simple palette might contain a paintbrush, a pencil, and an eraser.  

Palm_Inc
Palm, a pioneer in mobile and wireless Internet solutions and the world leader in handheld computing, was founded in 1992. In 1996, Palm introduced the Pilot 1000 and Pilot 5000 products that led the handheld computing revolution. The company's products for consumers, mobile professionals and businesses include Palm Treo smartphones, Palm LifeDrive mobile managers and Palm handheld computers, as well as software, services and accessories.
In 2010, Hewlett-Packard Co. (HP) bought Palm Inc. Later, in 2015, TCL Communication, known best for its Alcatel OneTouch device brand, purchased the Palm brand from HP.

palmtop
A small computer that literally fits in your palm. Compared to full-size computers, palmtops are severely limited, but they are practical for certain functions such as phone books and calendars. Palmtops that use a pen rather than a keyboard for input are often called hand-held computers or PDAs. 
Because of their small size, most palmtop computers do not include disk drives. However, many contain PCMCIA slots in which you can insert disk drives, modems, memory, and other devices.
Palmtops are also called PDAs, hand-held computers and pocket computers.

PAM
A form of signal modulation in which the data is encoded in the amplitude of a series, or train, of regularly recurrent signal pulses. PAM is used less frequently than PCM.

pam_limits_module
A Linux admin tool used to set hard and soft limits for users. The pam_limits sets parameters on system resources on a per-user (or per-group) basis. Using these tools, you can limit everything; from the maximum number of files a user can have open to the amount of CPU time.

PAN
 (1) In all capitals, PAN is short for Personal Area Network.  Based on the electric-field transmission medium,  is an IBM technology that allows individuals to exchange data with a simple touch or grasp, such as a handshake. A PAN user is equipped with a receiver and a transmitter, which constantly sends infinitesimal data-carrying currents -- in the 0.1-1 MHz band -- through the body and picks up currents when in very close range with another device or individual carrying a transmitter.  (2) In digital video recording and filmmaking, a pan refers to a horizontal camera movement where a wide view is required or one scene or person is transitioned to another. 

pan_and_scan
In the film and movie industry a term used to describe the method of adjusting a widescreen film to fit an ordinary television screen. This usually involves decreasing the horizontal width by cropping the left and (or) right sides of the original image. When vertically cropping the original, the process is called reverse pan and scan or tilt and scan.

panda-4

The fourth major "Panda" algorithm update and data refresh for the internal search algorithm used in the Google search engine. The Google Panda 4.0 update was rolled out in late May 2014 and is believed to have affected more than 7% of all English-language search queries.


pandora
An Internet radio and music recommendation service that utilizes the Music Genome Project to serve music and comedy content to its listeners.  The Music Genome Project has compiled hundreds of musical details for each song, including melody, harmony, instrumentation, rhythm, vocals and lyrics, which enable Pandora to play songs that share similar musical characteristics with the listener’s favorite songs, artists or musical genres. 
Subscribers are able to further refine their music selections by providing positive or negative feedback for songs chosen by Pandora.  Pandora offers both a free, advertised-supported plan and a paid subscription plan for its listeners.
In addition to providing its subscribers access on the Web via computers and laptops, Pandora is now also available on a variety of smartphones and mobile devices, including Apple’s iPhone and iPod Touch devices, Android-powered smartphones, BlackBerry platforms and Windows Mobile devices, as well as on various standalone systems such as Sonos products, Roku DVP radios and newer Web-enabled audio receivers from companies like Yamaha and Sony.

panorama_view
A function on some digital cameras that enables you to take multiple photos in sequence as you shoot. These images can later be stitched together to create one larger panoramic image. Some cameras may have the stitch built-in, while others may require you to do the stitching through software editing later. See also "The Digital Camera Picture" in  Webopedia's Quick Reference section.

PAP
Short for Password Authentication Protocol, the most basic form of authentication, in which a user's name and password are transmitted over a network and compared to a table of name-password pairs. Typically, the passwords stored in the table are encrypted. The Basic Authentication feature built into the HTTP protocol uses PAP. The main weakness of PAP is that both the username and password are transmitted "in the clear" -- that is, in an unencrypted form. Contrast with CHAP.


paper_feed
The mechanism or method that moves paper through a printer. For example, a tractor-feed mechanism is one that pulls the paper with a rotating wheel whose nubs catch in holes on either side of the paper.  

paper_guides
In print terminology the printer guides are adjustable clips, usually plastic that are found on the paper tray. The paper guides are designed to help keep the paper aligned. You can adjust these clips to the edges of the paper to keep the paper in place while being used by the printer.

paper_prototype
Commonly used in software development, it is a method used for testing and evaluating interfaces. While viewing the prototype(s), users attempt to complete tasks and provide feedback and thoughts on their interaction with paper versions of different screens, menus, and GUIs. Paper prototyping allows project development teams to cost-efficiently conduct usability tests with real users before the application is coded. The paper prototype can be hand drawn or created by using a graphics program. It is a visual representation of what the design will look like.

paper_size_systems
The ISO 216 paper size system is an international standard that is used in many places in the world in copy and print devices that defines paper sizes. Based on the metric system, the ISO paper size system uses a height-to-width ratio with an aspect ratio of 1 to 1.414 (The square root of 2). If a sheet is cut into two, the resulting halves are the same proportions as the original.   This standard defines three series of paper sizes; A, B and C. All successive paper sizes are derived from the base standard A0, which is a sheet of paper measuring 1 square meter or 841 x 1189mm. The most common size of paper is A4 (210x297mm), which is standard letterhead paper size. The C series of sizes is for envelopes, where the C4 (229 x 324mm) is defined under ISO 269 and is most often used with A4 size paper. The B series contains intermediate sizes for the A series but are sizes that are not frequently used. The United States and Canada do not widely use the ISO standard paper sizes. Instead, the United States uses the Letter, Legal and Executive system, and Canada uses a P-series of sizes. Unlike the international ISO 216 standard, these paper sizes are not based on a proportional aspect ratio system for size. 

paper_white_display
A high-quality monochrome monitor that displays characters in black against a white background. Such monitors are popular for desktop publishing because they most closely mimic real paper with black type. Some manufacturers make a distinction between normal white-background monitors and paper-white monitors, where the background is slightly tinted to look more like bonded paper.  

paperless_office
The idealized office in which paper is absent because all information is stored and transferred electronically. With the ever-expanding application of computers into business areas as diverse as accounting, desktop publishing, billing, mail, and scheduling, it seemed in the early 80s that the real paperless office was just around the corner. Ironically, just the opposite has transpired. The ease with which computers enable people to print all sorts of documents has created a flood of new paper. Indeed, perhaps the most widespread computer application is the fax machine, which uses paper by the ream.  Some analysts believe that the paperless office is still an achievable and laudable goal, but that certain key technologies such as optical character recognition (OCR) must be improved. Others, however, argue that the tangibleness of paper documents yields certain benefits that will never disappear.  

parabolic
In digital video and film terminology parabolic is a type of microphone that is used to record sounds from a great distance.

parallax
In digital photography, parallax is the term used to describe the difference between the image as seen by a viewing system and the image as recorded by the sensor. Variance occurs as subjects move closer to the lens. Only through the lens viewing systems avoid parallax error.  See "A Quick Guide to Digital Cameras" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia. See also Megapixel.net for news, reviews and a active community for digital camera and photography enthusiasts.

parallel
Refers to processes that occur simultaneously. Printers and other devices are said to be either parallel or serial. Parallel means the device is capable of receiving more than one bit at a time (that is, it receives several bits in parallel). Most modern printers are parallel.   

parallel_interface
A channel capable of transferring more than one bit simultaneously. Almost all personal computers come with at least one parallel interface. The other type of interface is a serial interfaces.   

parallel_port
Parallel port is a parallel interface for connecting an external device such as a printer. Most personal computers have both a parallel port and at least one serial port.
PC Parallel Ports
On PCs, the parallel port uses a 25-pin connector (type DB-25) and is used to connect printers, computers and other devices that need relatively high bandwidth. It is often called a Centronics interface after the company that designed the original standard for parallel communication between a computer and printer. (The modern parallel interface is based on a design by Epson.)
A newer type of parallel port, which supports the same connectors as the Centronics interface, is the EPP (Enhanced Parallel Port) or ECP (Extended Capabilities Port). Both of these parallel ports support bi-directional communication and transfer rates ten times as fast as the Centronics port.

parallel_processing
The simultaneous use of more than one CPU to execute a program. Ideally, parallel processing makes a program run faster because there are more engines (CPUs) running it. In practice, it is often difficult to divide a program in such a way that separate CPUs can execute different portions without interfering with each other.
Most computers have just one CPU, but some models have several. There are even computers with thousands of CPUs. With single-CPU computers, it is possible to perform parallel processing by connecting the computers in a network. However, this type of parallel processing requires very sophisticated software called distributed processingsoftware.
Note that parallel processing differs from multitasking, in which a single CPU executes several programs at once.

parameter
(1) Characteristic. For example, specifying parameters means defining the characteristics of something. In general, parameters are used to customize a program. For example, filenames, page lengths, and font specifications could all be considered parameters.
(2) In programming, the term parameter is synonymous with argument, a value that is passed to a routine.


paravirtual
A virtual machine (VM) mode in which operating systems do not require complete emulation of hardware devices. Paravirtual mode uses an API to interact with the host virtualization platform. Paravirtual mode doesn't require special virtualization technology hardware.  Contrast with full virtualization.

paravirtualized_operating_system
Refers to an operating system that is capable of running in paravirtual mode.

parent_directory
Refers to the directory above another directory. Every directory, except the root directory, lies beneath another directory. The higher directory is called the parent directory, and the lower directory is called a subdirectory. In DOS and UNIX systems, the parent directory is identified by two dots (..).  

Parental_Controls
In Windows Vista, Parental Controls is a new feature designed to let parents set controls for their children's computer use. Parental Controls are located in the Control Panel in Vista. To use Parental Controls, you first need to set up a new user account. The Parental Controls will be associated with this user account, which is the account you will have your children log on to the computer with. You can also choose to use activity reports to view your children's online activities. Options available under Parental Controls include the following:  Time Limits: setting specific time limits that will prevent logging on during certain times of the day Game Content: controls to access games where you can set an appropriate age level and content type you want to block Web Access: Allows you to restrict the Web sites that children visit and choose if you want to allow file transfers Program-specific Controls: allows you to keep your children from running specific programs on the computer 

parity
The quality of being either odd or even. The fact that all numbers have a parity is commonly used in data communications to ensure the validity of data. This is called parity checking.   

parity_checking
In communications, parity checking refers to the use of parity bits  to check that data has been transmitted accurately. The parity bit is added to every data unit (typically seven or eight bits ) that are transmitted. The parity bit for each unit is set so that all bytes have either an odd number or an even number of set bits.
Assume, for example, that two devices are communicating with even parity(the most common form of parity checking). As the transmitting device sends data, it counts the number of set bits in each group of seven bits. If the number of set bits is even, it sets the parity bit to 0; if the number of set bits is odd, it sets the parity bit to 1. In this way, every byte has an even number of set bits. On the receiving side, the device checks each byte to make sure that it has an even number of set bits. If it finds an odd number of set bits, the receiver knows there was an error during transmission.
The sender and receiver must both agree to use parity checking and to agree on whether parity is to be odd or even. If the two sides are not configured with the same parity sense, communication will be impossible.

park
(pärk) (v.) To lock the read/write head of a hard disk drive in a safe position so that the disk will not be damaged while moving the drive. The space where the head is parked typically is called the landing zone. Parking the disk is particularly important for portable computers, which are moved frequently. The disk will automatically unpark itself once you turn the power on.  All modern disk drives support automatic head parking, in which the drive automatically parks the head whenever the power is turned off. 

parse
In linguistics, to divide language into small components that can be analyzed. For example, parsing this sentence would involve dividing it into words and phrases and identifying the type of each component (e.g.,verb, adjective, or noun).
Parsing is a very important part of many computer science disciplines. For example, compilers must parse source code to be able to translate it into object code. Likewise, any application that processes complex commands must be able to parse the commands. This includes virtually all end-user applications.
Parsing is often divided into lexical analysis and semantic  parsing. Lexical analysis concentrates on dividing strings into components, called tokens, based on punctuationand other keys. Semantic parsing then attempts to determine the meaning of the string.

parser
A program that dissects source code so that it can be translated into object code. See parse. 

partial_classes
Partial classes and partial methods are two programming language features of .NET programming languages that make it possible for developers to extend and enhance auto-generated  code.  Partial classes allow for a single class's members to be divided among multiple source code files. At compile-time these multiple files get combined into a single class as if the class's members had all been specified in a single file. Compare with partial methods. See "An Overview of Partial Classes and Partial Methods" on ASP.NET.4GuysFromRolla.com.

partial_methods
Partial classes and partial methods are two programming language features of .NET programming languages that make it possible for developers to extend and enhance auto-generated  code.  Partial methods are methods defined in a partial class that are (optionally) divided across two files. With partial methods one file contains the method signature - the method name, its return type, and its input parameters - while the body is (optionally) defined in a separate file. If the partial method's body is not defined then the compiler automatically removes the partial method signature and all calls to the method at compile-time. Compare with  partial classes.  See "An Overview of Partial Classes and Partial Methods" on ASP.NET.4GuysFromRolla.com.

participant_map
In videoconferencing systems, the participant map is a visual map (graphic) that shows where each participant in the conference is sitting.

partition
(v) To divide memory or mass storage into isolated sections. In DOS systems, you can partition a disk, and each partition will behave like a separate disk drive. Partitioning is particularly useful if you run more than one operating system. For example, you might reserve one partition for Windows and another for UNIX.
In addition, partitioning on DOS and Windows machines can improve disk efficiency. This is because the FAT system used by these operating systems automatically assigns cluster size based on the disk size: the larger the disk, the larger the cluster. Unfortunately, large clusters can result in a wasted disk space, called slack space. There is an entire sector of the software industry devoted to building utilitiesthat let you partition your hard disk.
On Apple Macintosh computers, there are two types of partitioning: hard and soft. Hard partitioning is the same as DOS partitioning -- the disk is physically divided into different sections. Soft partitioning, on the other hand, does not physically affect the disk at all, but it fools the Finder into believing that the disk is partitioned. The advantage of this is that you can partition the disk without affecting the dataon it. With hard partitioning, it is usually necessary to reformat the entire disk.

partner_relationship_management
Abbreviated as PRM, partner relationship management is the term used to describe business  strategies and processes used by a company to communicate with its  channel partners.  In many ways, PRM software and processes are similar to customer relationship  management (CRM) as it  enables the organization to automate channel partner business functions and  gather real time information about the channel partner.
See "What  Are IT Channel Partners and Channel Programs?" in Webopedia's Quick Reference section for a  look at how IT channel partner programs work.

Pascal
Pronounced pass-kal. A high-level programming language developed by Niklaus Wirth in the late 1960s. The language is named after Blaise Pascal, a seventeenth-century French mathematician who constructed one of the first mechanical adding machines.  Pascal is best known for its affinity to structured programming techniques. The nature of the language forces programmers to design programs methodically and carefully. For this reason, it is a popular teaching language.  Despite its success in academia, Pascal has had only modest success in the business world. Part of the resistance to Pascal by professional programmers stems from its inflexibility and lack of tools for developing large applications.  To address some of these criticisms, Wirth designed a new language called Modula-2. Modula-2 is similar to Pascal in many respects, but it contains additional features. 

pass_along
In marketing terms it refers to a piece of marketing material, such as an e-mail newsletter, that goes beyond the original recipient. A pass along is "passed along" to a second person by the recipient.

passive_component
In electrical, computer or storage systems, passive components are those that do not require electrical power to operate (e.g., not capable of power gain). This could include the chassis, capacitors, resistors or enclosures that do not require electrical power to operate but would exclude system components such as the power supply, fans, storage device, transistors, diodes and other controllers (called active components).


passive_impostor_acceptance
(n.) In a biometric security system, when an impostor intentionally submits his own biometric sample and claims the identity of another enrollee (either intentionally or unintentionally) with the purpose of gaining access to a system. Passive impostor acceptance implies that the impostor successfully gains entrance into the system using the verified identity.
Compare with active impostor acceptance.

passive_reconnaissance
(pas´iv ri-kon´&-zents) (n.) The process of collecting information about an intended target of a malicious hack without the target knowing what is occurring. Typical passive reconnaissance can include physical observation of an enterprise's building, sorting through discarded computer equipment in an attempt to find equipment that contains data or discarded paper with usernames and passwords, eavesdropping on employee conversations, researching the target through common Internet tools such as Whois, impersonating an employee in an attempt to collect information, and packet sniffing.
Compare with active reconnaissance.

passive_tag
In an RFID system the transponder which contains the data to be transmitted is called an RF tag. Passive RF tags obtain operating power generated from the RF reader. They are smaller and lighter than active tags but have a shorter communication range and require a high powered reader. Passive tags are generally read-only and as such, once it is programmed with data, that data cannot be modified.  The opposite of a passive tag is an active tag.

passive_matrix_display
A common type of flat-panel display consisting of a grid of horizontal and vertical wires. At the intersection of each grid is an LCD element which constitutes a single pixel, either letting light through or blocking it. A higher quality and more expensive type of display, called an active-matrix display, uses a transistor to control each pixel.  In the mid-90s, it appeared that passive-matrix displays would eventually become extinct due to the higher quality of active-matrix displays. However, the high cost of producing active-matrix displays, and new technologies such as DSTN, CSTN and HPA that improve passive-matrix displays, have cause passive-matrix displays to make a surprising comeback. 

passphrase
Similar to a password it a collection of words made up of any number of characters and also contains blank spaces. Passphrases are commonly used for authentication in  security programs and  cryptographic systems. A passphrase is also used to authenticate both sides of a connection when pairing Bluetooth devices.
 
 

password
(n.) A secret series of characters that enables a user to access a file, computer, or program. On multi-user systems, each user must enter his or her password before the computer will respond to commands. The password helps ensure that unauthorized users do not access the computer. In addition, data files and programs may require a password.
Ideally, the password should be something that nobody could guess. In practice, most people choose a password that is easy to remember, such as their name or their initials. This is one reason it is relatively easy to break into most computer systems.
 

password_cracking
The process of attempting to guess or crack passwords to gain access to a computer system or network. Crackers will generally use a variety of tools, scripts, or software to crack a system password. The goal of the cracker is to ideally obtain the password for root (UNIX) or system and administrator (Windows, NT). Password cracks work by comparing every encrypted dictionary word against the entries in system password file until a match is found.
See also crack.

paste
To copy an object from a buffer (or clipboard) to a file. In word processing, blocks of text are moved from one place to another by cutting and pasting. When you cut a block of text, the word processor removes the block from your file and places it in a temporary holding area (a buffer). You can then paste the material in the buffer somewhere else.  Modern operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, allow you to cut an object from one application and paste it into another. Depending on how the object is pasted, it can be either linked  or embedded.   

PASV
The data transfer process (DTP) for FTP establishes and manages the data connection.  The DTP can be passive or active. Passive, or PASV, is a command that requests that the server "listen" on a data port (which is not its default data port) and to wait for a connection rather than initiate one upon receipt of a transfer command. Certain FTP servers support both active and passive transfers while other FTP servers only allow active transfers. * [Adapted from RFC 959] See also FTP.

PAT
Short for port address translation, a type of network address translation. During PAT, each computer on LAN is translated to the same IP address, but with a different port number assignment.
PAT is also referred to as overloading, port-level multiplexed NAT or single address NAT.

patch
(n.) Also called a service patch, a fix to a program bug. A patch is an actual piece of object code that is inserted into (patched into) an executable program. Patches typically are available as downloads over the Internet.  

patch_cord
Also known as a patch cable, a patch cord is a piece of copper wire or fiber optic cable that connects circuits on a patch panel.

patch_panel
A panel of network ports contained together, usually within a telecommunications closet, that connects incoming and outgoing lines of a LAN or other communication, electronic or electrical system. In a LAN, the patch panel connects the network's computers to each other and to the outside lines that enable the LAN to connect to the Internet or another WAN. Connections are made with patch cords. The patch panel allows circuits to be arranged and rearranged by plugging and unplugging the patch cords.

patent
The exclusive right, granted by the government, to make use of an invention or process for a specific period of time, usually 14 years.

patent_pending
Patent Pending (abbreviated Pat. Pend.) means a United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) statement indicating that a patent has been applied, for but not yet granted.
Legal Use of Patent Pending
The Patent Pending (or "patent applied for") statement is used by inventors, manufacturers and sellers to let others know an application has been filed and is currently in the approval process. It is against the law to use the phrase Patent Pending unless you actually have a patent awaiting approval. 
How Long Does Patent Approval Take?
The United States Patent and Trademark Office website states "most patent applications filed on or after November 29, 2000, will be published 18 months after the filing date of the application, or any earlier filing date relied upon under Title 35, United States Code."

path
)(1) In DOS and Windows systems, a path is a list of directories where the operating system looks for executable files if it is unable to find the file in the working directory. You can specify the list of directories with the PATH command.  (2) Another name for pathname.  Also see transmission path.

pathname
)A sequence of symbols and names that identifies a file. Every file has a name, called a filename, so the simplest type of pathname is just a filename. If you specify a filename as the pathname, the operating system looks for that file in your current  working directory. However, if the file resides in a different directory, you must tell the operating system how to find that directory. You do this by specifying a path that the operating system must follow.  The pathname always starts from your working directory or from the root directory. Each operating system has its own rules for specifying paths. In DOS systems, for example, the root directory is named \, and each subdirectory is separated by an additional backslash. In UNIX, the root directory is named /, and each subdirectory is followed by a slash. In Macintosh environments, directories are separated by a colon.   

pattern
The term pattern relates to the use of patterns in architecture. A pattern is the formalization of a problem/solution pair, used to make an object-oriented design decision. The purpose of a pattern is to codify existing design knowledge so that developers are not constantly re-inventing the wheel. Also, by naming these patterns, it eases communication among developers. The term pattern was first coined by Christopher Alexander et al. in 1977. * [Source: Patterns in Object-Oriented Development]

pattern_recognition
An important field of computer science concerned with recognizing patterns, particularly visual and sound patterns. It is central to optical character recognition (OCR), voice recognition, and handwriting recognition.  

Pause_key
A key that you can use to temporarily halt the display of data. Generally, you use the Pause key to freeze data that is being scrolled on the display screen. To continue scrolling, you can press any key.  In DOS, an alternative to using the Pause key is to use the MORE command, which displays one screenful of data at a time. 

Pay_As_You_Go
A type of mobile phone service subscription which allows cellphone owners to pay in advance for talk time, and add add more airtime as needed, by day, week or month. Pay-as-you-go services require no contract, and often no sign-up fees other than mobile phone service hook-up. Usually airtime is purchased in the form of a calling card where the user inputs a code from the calling card to use the purchased airtime minutes. Also called a pre-paid service.

pay_per_lead
A type of affiliate marketing program where the advertiser pays the  affiliate based on conversion of leads, such as a file or software download, completion of a sign-up form for a newsletter, trial offer sign-up, or other desired action. If a customer follows an affiliate link to the advertiser's site and completes the required action in accordance with the affiliate agreement, the affiliate is paid. See "How Affiliate Marketing Works" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. Also see Refer-It.com, a directory of referral & affiliate programs for e-commerce, featuring information on over 6,500 affiliate programs.

pay_per_sale
A type of affiliate marketing program where the advertiser pays the  affiliate based on conversion of sales. If a customer follows an affiliate link to the advertiser's site and makes a purchase in accordance with the affiliate agreement, the affiliate is paid. Affiliates can earn a higher commission through pay-per-sale affiliate programs, however these types of programs usually have the lowest conversion rate. See "How Affiliate Marketing Works" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. Also see Refer-It.com, a directory of referral & affiliate programs for e-commerce, featuring information on over 6,500 affiliate programs.

payload
The term used to describe the malicious activity that is the result of an activated computer virus. While not all viruses have a payload, some payloads will perform destructive actions. Also see The Difference Between a Virus, Worm and Trojan Horse in the Did You Know? section of Webopedia. 

payload_trigger
The action or condition that causes a virus to activate. Some viruses may activate on pre-determined user actions, a certain program activation or even on a set date and time. Also see The Difference Between a Virus, Worm and Trojan Horse in the Did You Know? section of Webopedia. 

payment_gateway
The service that automates the payment transaction between the shopper and merchant. It is usually a third-party service that is actually a system of computer processes that process, verify, and accept or decline credit card transactions on behalf of the merchant through secure Internet connections. The payment gateway is the infrastructure that allows a merchant to accept credit card and other forms of electronic payment. When referring to payment gateways used for Internet transactions, it may also be called an IP payment gateway. See gateway  for further understanding of how a gateway works.

payment_processing
The term used to describe the process and service that automates payment transactions between the shopper and merchant. It is usually a third-party service that is actually a system of computer processes that process, verify, and accept or decline credit card transactions on behalf of the merchant through secure Internet connections.
See Electronic Shopping Carts & Payment Processing in Webopedia's Quick Reference Section. 

payment_threshold
In affiliate marketing programs, the payment threshold refers to the minimum accumulated commission an affiliate must earn to initiate a payment from the affiliate program. See "How Affiliate Marketing Works" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. Also see Refer-It.com, a directory of referral & affiliate programs for e-commerce, featuring information on over 6,500 affiliate programs.

PayPal
Founded in 1998, PayPal, an eBay Company, is akin to an online (Internet) banking service. It enables any individual or business with an e-mail address to securely and quickly send and receive payments online. PayPal's service builds on the existing financial infrastructure of bank accounts and credit cards and uses the world's most advanced proprietary fraud prevention systems to create a safe, global, real-time payment solution. Located in San Jose, Calif., PayPal was acquired by eBay Inc. in October, 2002.

PayPal_Button_Factory
Pages on the PayPal Web site that merchants and online sellers can access to create HTML code for PayPal that can be copied and pasted onto their own Web site. The Button Factories include single-item purchases, donations, subscriptions, Buy it Now and also multiple item, purchases which include PayPal Shopping cart.

PayPal_SMS_Security_Key
A service that enables PayPal customers to use their mobile phones to authenticate transactions through a service that lets customers use SMS messaging to get a randomly generated access code to log into their accounts. The PayPal SMS Security Key is an extension of PayPal's current Security Key service, which uses a hardware token. However, unlike the current service, which charges customers $5 for the token, the new service is free. Customers will have to pay their carriers' charges for SMS services.

PayPal_Verified
A PayPal Verified account is one where the account owner has taken the steps required by PayPal to verify their primary e-mail address and confirmed a bank account associated with the account.

paywall
Paywalls are systems designed to monetize online and other digital information by preventing visitors from accessing web sites and similar content providers without having a paid subscription.  Online news and sports web sites are the most frequent users of paywalls, with some sites implementing hard paywalls while others deploy soft paywalls.  A hard paywall's content restrictions are much more stringent than a soft paywall, allowing either no access or minimal access to free content.  A soft paywall, on the other hand, provides significant access to free content as a means of encouraging users to subscribe for access to premium content.

PBC
A type of memory cache built into many modern DRAM controller and chipset designs. Pipeline burst caches use two techniques - a burst mode that pre-fetches memory contents before they are requested, and pipelining so that one memory value can be accessed in the cache at the same time that another memory value is accessed in DRAM. The purpose of pipeline burst caches is to minimize wait states so that memory can be accessed as fast a possible by the microprocessor.  The term is often abbreviated as PBC. 

PBX
Short for private branch exchange, a private telephone network used within an enterprise. Users of the PBX share a certain number of outside lines for making telephone calls external to the PBX.
Most medium-sized and larger companies use a PBX because it's much less expensive than connecting an external telephone line to every telephone in the organization. In addition, it's easier to call someone within a PBX because the number you need to dial is typically just 3 or 4 digits.
A new variation on the PBX theme is the centrex, which is a PBX with all switching occurring at a local telephone office instead of at the company's premises.

PC
(1) Short for personal computer or IBM PC. The first personal computer produced by IBM was called the PC, and increasingly the term PC came to mean IBM or IBM-compatible personal computers, to the exclusion of other types of personal computers, such as Macintoshes.
In recent years, the term PC has become more and more difficult to pin down. In general, though, it applies to any personal computer based on an Intel microprocessor, or on an Intel-compatible microprocessor. For nearly every other component, including the operating system, there are several options, all of which fall under the rubric of PC
(2) PC can stand for printed circuit, so a PC board  is a printed circuit board.

personal_computer
A personal computer (PC) is a small, relatively inexpensive computer designed for an individual user. In price, personal computers range anywhere from a few hundred dollars to thousands of dollars. All are based on the microprocessor technology that enables manufacturers to put an entire CPU on one chip.
At home, the most popular use for personal computers is for playing games. Businesses use personal computers for word processing, accounting, desktop publishing, and for running spreadsheet and database management applications.
Personal Computers in the Late 1970s
Personal computers first appeared in the late 1970s. One of the first and most popular personal computers was the Apple II, introduced in 1977 by Apple Computer. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, new models and competing operating systems seemed to appear daily. Then, in 1981, IBM entered the fray with its first personal computer, known as the IBM PC. The IBM PC quickly became the personal computer of choice, and most other personal computer manufacturers fell by the wayside. One of the few companies to survive IBM's onslaught was Apple Computer, which remains a major player in the personal computer marketplace.

PC_card
A computer  device packaged in a small card about the size of a credit card and conforming to the PCMCIA standard. 

PC_DOS
The name IBM uses to market its version of the DOS operating system. 

pc-on-a-stick
PC-on-a-Stick is a term that refers to a small USB flash drive-sized device that can be plugged into an HDMI-compatible TV or monitor to provide a complete personal computing (PC) experience. PC-on-a-Stick devices are primarily designed for light productivity work as well as Web browsing, social networking, video chatting and media streaming.
Also called Stick PCs or Compute Sticks, PC-on-a-Stick devices are typically pared with a Bluetooth wireless keyboard and mouse for user input, although USB wired hardware can be used as well via an included USB port on the PC-on-a-Stick. Most PC-on-a-Stick devices are powered by a ARM or Intel Atom system-on-a-chip (SoC) with either Windows (8.1 or Windows 10) or a Linux distribution (typically Ubuntu) serving as the device's operating system.
PC-on-a-Stick Vendors and Use Cases
Intel released its version of PC-on-a-Stick as the Intel Compute Stick in 2015, and Lenovo, Archos, Amazon (Fire Stick) and Google (Chromecast) all have their own PC-on-a-Stick devices available. Prices for these devices range on the low end from about $35 - $40 for the limited-functionality Chromecast and Fire Stick devices to between $99 for the Archos and $149 for the Windows version of the Intel Compute Stick at the high end.

PC_TV
A combination of a personal computer and television. PC/TVs are computers with built-in television boards. 

PCI
(1) Short for Peripheral Component Interconnect, a local bus standard developed by Intel Corporation. Most modern PCs include a PCI bus in addition to a more general ISA expansion bus. PCI is also used on some versions of the Macintosh computer. PCI is a 64-bit bus, though it is usually implemented as a 32-bit bus. It can run at clock speeds of 33 or 66 MHz. At 32 bits and 33 MHz, it yields a throughput rate of 133 MBps. Although it was developed by Intel, PCI is not tied to any particular family of microprocessors. Also see  PCI-X and  PCI Express. 
(2) Short for Payment Card Industry. See related terms PCI compliance (PCI DSS) and Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC).


PCI_Express
(pē-sē-ī ik-spres´) (n.) An I/O interconnect bus standard (which includes a protocol and a layered architecture) that expands on and doubles the data transfer rates of original PCI. PCI Express is a two-way, serial connection that carries data in packets along two pairs of point-to-point data lanes, compared to the single parallel data bus of traditional PCI that routes data at a set rate. Initial bit rates for PCI Express reach 2.5Gb/s per lane direction, which equate to data transfer rates of approximately 200MB/s. PCI Express was developed so that high-speed interconnects such as 1394b, USB 2.0, InfiniBand and Gigabit Ethernet would have an I/O architecture suitable for their transfer high speeds.  PCI Express, also known as 3GIO (for third-generation Input/Output) is compatible with existing PCI systems.

PCI_Express_x16
The PCI Express x16 graphics interface (also called PCIe x16) offers increased bandwidth and scalability over the previous AGP8X generation. PCI Express x16 allows up to 4 GB/s of peak bandwidth per direction, and up to 8 GB/s concurrent bandwidth. PCI-Express x16 is used by the Intel 915 and 925 and other chipsets which support PCI-Express. See also PCI Express.

PCI_modem
A modem that plugs into a PCI bus and is controlled by a device driver. Other types of modems may use the older ISA bus slot. See also modem.

PCI_Security_Standards_Council
The PCI (Payment Card Industry) Security Standards Council is an industry-led standards organization, founded by American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB, MasterCard Worldwide and Visa International to provide a formalized standards body to manage the ongoing evolution of PCI Security Standards. The PCI Security Standards Council is responsible for the following tasks:   Develop and manage the PCI Data Security Standard, including maintenance, clarification and revisions of the Standard. Establish and maintain industry-level approval processes for qualified security assessors and network scanning vendors. Publish and distribute the PCI Data Security Standard. Provide an open forum where all key stakeholders can provide input into the ongoing development of other payment security standards.  

PCI_SSC
Short for Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), it is the governing organization and open forum responsible for the development, management, education, and awareness of  PCI Security Standards, including the Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and the Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA-DSS).

PCI_DSS
Short for Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS), PCI DSS is a standard that all organizations, including online retailers, must follow when storing, processing and transmitting their customer's credit card data. The Data Security Standard (DSS) was developed and the standard is maintained by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC).  To be PCI complaint companies must use a firewall between wireless network and their cardholder data environment, use the latest security and authentication such as WPA/WPA2 and also change default settings for wired privacy keys, and use a network intrusion detection system.  The PCI DSS standard, as of September 2009 (DSS v 1.2), includes the following 12 requirements for best security practices: Build and Maintain a Secure Network 1. Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data 2. Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters   Protect Cardholder Data 3. Protect stored cardholder data 4. Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks   Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program 5. Use and regularly update anti-virus software 6. Develop and maintain secure systems and applications   Implement Strong Access Control Measures 7. Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know 8. Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access 9. Restrict physical access to cardholder data   Regularly Monitor and Test Networks 10. Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data 11. Regularly test security systems and processes   Maintain an Information Security Policy 12. Maintain a policy that addresses information security   [Source:  PCI Security Standards Council]

PCI_X
Short for PCI extended, an enhanced PCI bus. PCI-X is backward-compatible with existing PCI cards. It improves upon the speed of PCI from 133 MBps to as much as 1 GBps.  PCI-X was designed jointly by IBM, HP and Compaq to increase performance of high bandwidth devices, such as Gigabit Ethernet and Fibre Channel, and processors that are part of a cluster.

PCL
Abbreviation of Printer Control Language, the page description language (PDL) developed by Hewlett Packard and used in many of their laser and ink-jet printers. PCL 5 and later versions support a scalable font technology called Intellifont.   

PCM
Abbreviated as PCM, phase change memory is a type of non-volatile memory that is much faster than the common flash memory, from 500 to 1,000 times faster, and it also uses up to one half the power. Phase change memory uses a semiconductor alloy that can be changed rapidly between an ordered, crystalline phase having lower electrical resistance to a disordered, amorphous phase with much higher electrical resistance. Because no electrical power is required to maintain either phase of the material, so phase-change memory is non-volatile.

PCMCIA
Short for Personal Computer Memory Card International Association, and pronounced as separate letters, PCMCIA is an organization consisting of some 500 companies that has developed a standard for small, credit card-sized devices, called PC Cards. Originally designed for adding memory to portable computers, the PCMCIA standard has been expanded several times and is now suitable for many types of devices. There are in fact three types of PCMCIA cards. All three have the same rectangular size (85.6 by 54 millimeters), but different widths

Type I cards can be up to 3.3 mm thick, and are used primarily for adding additional ROM or RAM to a computer.


Type II cards can be up to 5.5 mm thick. These cards are often used for modem and fax modem cards.


Type III cards can be up to 10.5 mm thick, which is sufficiently large for portable disk drives.

As with the cards, PCMCIA slots also come in three sizes:

A Type I slot can hold one Type I card


A Type II slot can hold one Type II card or one Type I card


A Type III slot can hold one Type III card or any combination of two Type I or II cards.

In general, you can exchange PC Cards on the fly, without rebooting your computer. For example, you can slip in a fax modem card when you want to send a faxand then, when you're done, replace the fax modem card with a memory card.

PCS
Short for personal communications service, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) term used to describe a set of digital cellular technologies being deployed in the U.S. Also referred to as digital cellular, PCS works over CDMA (also called IS-95), GSM, and North American TDMA (also called IS-136) air interfaces. Three of the most important distinguishing features of PCS systems are:  They are completely digital They operate at the 1900MHz frequency range (unlike other cellular systems that operate in the 800MHz frequency range)They can be used internationally  PCS is a second-generation mobile communications technology.

PCX
Originally developed by ZSOFT for its PC Paintbrush program, PCX is a graphics file format for graphics programs running on PCs. It is supported by most optical scanners, fax programs, and desktop publishing systems. Files in the PCX format end with a ".pcx" ( pronounced dot -p-c-x) extension. Two other common bit map formats are BMP and TIFF.   

PDA
Short for personal digital assistant, a handheld device that combines computing, telephone/fax, Internet and networking features. A typical PDA can function as a cellular phone, fax sender, Web browser and personal organizer. PDAs may also be referred to as a palmtop, hand-held computer or pocket computer.
Not a Portable Computer
Unlike portable computers, most PDAs began as pen-based, using a stylus rather than a keyboard for input. This means that they also incorporated handwriting recognition features. Some PDAs can also react to voice input by using voice recognition technologies. PDAs are available in either a stylus or keyboard version.
Apple Computer, which introduced the Newton MessagePad in 1993, was one of the first companies to offer PDAs. Shortly thereafter, several other manufacturers offered similar products. One of the most popular brands of PDAs was the series of Palm Pilots from Palm, Inc.

PDC
Short for Primary Domain Controller, a server in a Windows NT network that maintains a read-write directory of user accounts and security information. The PDC authenticates usernames and passwords when members log into the network. Members only have to log into one domain to access all resources in the network.  In a trusted relationship, one domain may gain access to other domains. In this case, members who log into the first domain will have access to the resources in the other domains.  It is also a good idea to have at least one backup domain controller (BDC) in a domain.  Windows 2000 (W2K) approaches the domain controller concept a little differently. Unlike Windows NT, where a PDC must be accessible to make changes to the directory, W2K relies on Active Directory's multimaster replication model to update all domain controllers when only one is updated. There is no PDC or BDC. All domain controllers are equal.

PDF
PDF is short for Portable Document Format.
PDF is a file format developed by Adobe Systems in 1992. PDF captures formatting information from a variety of desktop publishing applications, making it possible to send formatted documents and have them appear on the recipient's monitor or printer as they were intended.This is because a PDF will maintain the original fonts, images, graphics as well as the exact layout of the file.
How to Create and View PDF files
A PDF file can be shared, viewed, and printed by anyone using the free Adobe Reader software regardless of the operating system, original design application or fonts. The tools to view and create PDF files, called Acrobat, were released in 1993. To view a file in PDF format, you need Adobe Reader, a free application distributed by Adobe Systems. Initially, the tools to create and view PDFs were expensive. Later, Adobe launched a free version of Acrobat Reader.

Packet_Data_Protocol_PDP
Short for Packet Data Protocol, it is a network protocol used by packet switching external networks to communicate with GPRS (General Packet Radio Services) networks. The PDP data structure is present on both the SGSN (Service GPRS Support Node) and the GGSN (gateway GPRS support node) that contains the subscriber's (MS) session information during an active session.

PDU
(1) Short for Protocol Data Unit. The term used to describe data as it moves from one layer of the OSI model to another. In this reference, PDU is often used synonymously with packet.   (2) Short for Power Distribution Unit. An electrical device used to control the distribution of power to individual loads. The PDU may be a stand-alone controlled device or it may be integrated directly into the UPS (uninterruptible power supply).

PEAP
Pronounced "peep" and short for Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol, a protocol developed jointly by Microsoft, RSA Security and Cisco for transmitting authentication data, including passwords, over 802.11 wireless networks.  PEAP authenticates wireless LAN clients using only server-side digital certificates by creating an encrypted SSL/TLS tunnel between the client and the authentication server. The tunnel then protects the subsequent user authentication exchange.

PEAR
Short for PHP Extension and Application Repository, PEAR is a framework and distribution system for reusable PHP components. PEAR is a community-driven project with the PEAR Group as the governing body. The project was founded by Stig S. Bakken in 1999.   The code in PEAR is partitioned in packages, where each package is a separate project with its own development team, version number, release cycle, documentation and a defined relation to other packages (including dependencies). Packages are distributed as gzipped tar files with a description file inside, and installed on your local system using the PEAR installer. There are two types of packages: source packages (containing source files only), and binary packages (containing platform-specific binary files, and possible source files). [Source: PEAR Manual] 

PEBCAK
PEBCAK is technical support shorthand (slang) for "Problem Exists between Chair and Keyboard". Generally this term is used by technical support personnel to describe a problem that was caused by the computer user as opposed to a technical problem with the physical computer equipment.

pedestal_server
A type of computer rack. It is box-like frame or a columnar support for a server and may include wheels for easy transportation.

peek_and_poke
In BASIC programming peek and poke are the functions used to view and alter a byte of memory. Peek displays the contents while poke changes it.


peeps
Abbreviation for "people". Peeps is commonly used in newsgroups/a>, chat rooms, instant messaging,  text messaging, SMS, e-mail and other real time text-based communications.
 
See also "Text Messaging Abbreviations" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia for definitions to hundreds of frequently used chat abbreviations.

peer_to_peer_architecture
Often referred to simply as peer-to-peer, or abbreviated P2P, a type of network in which each workstation has equivalent capabilities and responsibilities. This differs from client/server architectures, in which some computers are dedicated to serving the others. Peer-to-peer networks are generally simpler, but they usually do not offer the same performance under heavy loads.
Also see All About Peer-To-Peer Architecture in Webopedia's "Did You Know...?" section.

peer_to_peer_mode
An 802.11 networking framework in which devices or stations communicate directly with each other, without the use of an access point (AP). Ad-hoc mode is also referred to as peer-to-peer mode or an Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS). Ad-hoc mode is useful for establishing a network where wireless infrastructure does not exist or where services are not required.

peering
A relationship between two or more small- or medium-sized ISPs in which the ISPs create a direct link between each other and agree to forward each other's packets directly across this link instead of using the standard Internet backbone. For example, suppose a client of ISP X wants to access a web site hosted by ISP Y. If X and Y have a peering relationship, the HTTP packets will travel directly between the two ISPs. In general, this results in faster access since there are fewer hops. And for the ISPs, it's more economical because they don't need to pay fees to a third-party Network Service Provider (NSP).  Peering can also involve more than two ISPs, in which case all traffic destined for any of the ISPs is first routed to a central exchange, called a peering point, and then forwarded to the final destination. This is similar to the Network Access Points (NAPs) managed by the NSPs, but on a smaller scale. 

pen_computer
A computer that utilizes an electronic pen (called a stylus) rather than a keyboard for input. Pen computers generally require special operating systems that support handwriting recognition so that users can write on the screen or on a tablet instead of typing on a keyboard. Most pen computers are hand-held devices, which are too small for a full-size keyboard.   

pen_tool
In graphics software, the pen tool is frequently used in the creation of smooth-edged selections, but is not a type of selection tool. The Pen Tool creates vector paths that can be converted into selections that in turn can be used to extract or mask groups of pixels.

Pentium_4
The next generation of microprocessors from Intel. Features such as a 32-bit microprocessor, hyper-pipelined technology, a rapid execution engine and a 100MHz system bus that delivers three times the bandwidth of the Pentium III processor are designed to enhance online gaming, digital video and photography, speech recognition and MP3 encoding. Current speeds run at 1.4 and 1.5 GHz. The Pentium 4 processor also features:  New Level 1 cache technology - Execution Trace Cache, which delivers a higher performance instruction cache than the Pentium III through a more efficient use of cache memory.  NetBurst microarchitecture doubles the pipelength depth to 20 stages, and increases the frequency capability.   Streaming SIMD extension 2 (SSE2) -- 144 new instructions, a 128-bit SIMD integer arithmetic and 128-bit SIMD double precision floating point instructions. 

Pentium_II
The Pentium II builds on the design of the Pentium Pro, but adds an additional 2 million transistors to bring the total up to 7.5 million. Current versions of the chip run at speeds of 233, 266, 300, and 333 MHz. In addition, the Pentium II features the following:  A Singled Edge Contact (SEC) cartridge that fits into Slot 1 Dual Independent Bus (DIB) architecture 512K L2 cache 32K L1 cache MMX support   

Pentium_III
Intel builds on the technology it developed with the Pentium II microprocessors. The Pentium III processor comes with a Synchronized Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM), allowing for an extremely fast transfer of data between the microprocessor and the memory. 70 new instructions, called Streaming SIMD Extensions, enhance multimedia and 3D performance. An advanced transfer cache and system buffering are able to meet higher data bandwidth requirements.   * Dual independent bus (DIB) architecture  * 100 MHz front-side bus speed  * A multi-transaction system bus  * MMX support  

Pentium_microprocessor
A 32-bit microprocessor introduced by Intel in 1993. It contains 3.3 million transistors, nearly triple the number contained in its predecessor, the 80486 chip. Though still in production, the Pentium processor has been superseded by the Pentium Pro and Pentium II microprocessors. Since 1993, Intel has developed the Pentium III and more recently the Pentium 4 microprocessors. 

Pentium_Pro
The Pentium Pro is Intel's sixth generation microprocessor (P6). Although, it shares the same name as the fifth-generation Pentium microprocessor, the Pentium Pro is architecturally quite different. Thanks to modern design techniques, including superpipelining, dynamic execution, and on-chip L2 cache, the Pentium Pro can perform at nearly twice the speed of previous Pentium microprocessors.   

perceptual_coding
In digital audio perceptual coding is a coding method used to reduce the amount of data needed to produce high-quality sound. Perceptual coding takes advantage of the human ear, screening out a certain amount of sound that is perceived as noise. In perceptual coding you reduce or eliminate the sounds that the ear would perceive as noise.

perfect_forward_secrecy
A key-establishment protocol, used to secure VPN communications. If one  encryption key is compromised only data encrypted by that specific key is compromised. For perfect forward secrecy (PFS) to exist the key used to protect transmission of data must not be used to derive any additional keys.

perigee
In satellite communications, most satellites orbit the earth in elliptical patterns with the earth not in the exact center of the orbital pattern. When a satellite is at its closest point to the earth, it is at the perigee of the orbit. When a satellite is at its furthest point from the earth, it is at the apogee of the orbit.


peripheral_device
A peripheral device is defined as a computer device, such as a keyboard or printer, that is not part of the essential computer (i.e., the memory and microprocessor). These auxiliary devices are intended to be connected to the computer and used.
Types of Peripheral Devices 
Peripheral devices can be external or internal.

Examples of external peripherals include mouse, keyboard, printer, monitor, external Zip drive or scanner.
Examples of internal peripherals include CD-ROM drive, CD-R drive or internal modem.

Today's new devices, such as tablets, smartphones and wearable computing devices are considered peripherals as they can be connected and used on a computer system. The difference, however, is that these devices can run independently of the computer system, unlike a computer mouse, for example.

Perl
Short for Practical Extraction and Report Language, Perl is a programming language developed by Larry Wall, especially designed for processing text. Because of its strong text processing abilities, Perl has become one of the most popular languages for writing CGI scripts. Perl is an interpretive language, which makes it easy to build and test simple programs. 

permalink
Short for permanent link, a permalink is a direct link to a single entry on content on a blog. As a blog is updated with a new post, that specific post will get its own page with a URL that can be used rather than linking to the main URL of the blog. On many blogs the text "permalink" will appear below a blog post as a hyperlink that takes users to the post as its own page.

Perpendicular_recording
A method of recording data to a hard disk drive (HDD). Perpendicular recording aligns data bits vertically  perpendicular to the disk, which allows for additional room on a disk to pack more data, thus, enabling higher recording densities. Contrast with Longitudinal recording.Also see "What Is Perpendicular Hard Drive Technology?" in Webopedia's "Did You know..." section.

persistent_cookie
Also called a permanent cookie, or a stored cookie, a cookie that is stored on a user��s hard drive until it expires (persistent cookies are set with expiration dates) or until the user deletes the cookie. Persistent cookies are used to collect identifying information about the user, such as Web surfing behavior or user preferences for a specific Web site.  Compare with session cookie.

personal_cloud_storage
A form of cloud storage that applies to storing an individual’s data in the cloud and providing the individual with access to the data from anywhere. Personal cloud storage also often enables syncing and sharing stored data across multiple devices such as mobile phones and tablet computers. Personal cloud storage is also frequently referred to as mobile cloud storage or pocket cloud storage.
Apple's iCloud, Google Drive, Windows SkyDrive and Amazon's Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) are currently the most popular examples of personal cloud storage. Hard drive manufacturers are increasingly providing personal cloud storage services as well via offerings like the Western Digital MyBook Live and Seagate GoFlex lines of hard drives.
See also Webopedia's Cloud Computing Dictionary Resource and Cloud Computing Security Challenges.

personal_computer_game
personal computer games are more commonly referred to as computer games or PC games. They are played on the personal computer with standard computer interface devices such as the keyboard and mouse, or a joystick or gamepad. Video feedback is received by the gamer through the computer screen, and soundthrough speakers or headphones.
Also see  All About Multiplayer PC Gaming in Webopedia's "Did You Know...?" section.

personal_finance_manager
A simple accounting program that helps individuals manage their finances. Personal finance managers help you balance your checkbook and keep track of investments. Some can even help you pay your bills by printing out checks or transferring money electronically from your bank account.   

personal_information_manager
Abbreviated PIM, a type of software application designed to help users organize random bits of information. Although the category is fuzzy, most PIMs enable you to enter various kinds of textual notes -- reminders, lists, dates -- and to link these bits of information together in useful ways. Many PIMs also include calendar, scheduling, and calculator programs.

personal_Internet_communicator
The personal Internet communicator (PIC) is an affordable consumer device designed to provide managed Internet access for people in global, high-growth markets to enhance communications, entertainment, and education opportunities. The PIC is not a computer, although it is driven by AMD processor technology. The PIC is a connecting device; a simple and accessible platform designed to work with existing service provider dial-up or broadband infrastructure that can deliver basic Internet functions such as e-mail, downloads, Web browsing, and more.

personal_storage_table_pst
A PST file, or personal storage table (.pst) file, is a Microsoft Outlook Data File that stores a user's Outlook data for POP3, IMAP and web-based mail accounts, including all mail folders and the items within the folders, such as emails, email attachments, to do items and appointments, contacts and more.
Personal storage table files are used by all versions of Microsoft Outlook, from Outlook 2000 up to Outlook 2010. PST files in early versions of Outlook (Outlook 2000 and Outlook 2002) were stored in ANSI format and have a maximum size of 2GB, while later versions save the PST file in Unicode format and have a maximum size of 20GB (Outlook 2003 and Outlook 2007) or 50GB (Outlook 2010).


PVR
Short for personal video recorder, PVR is a generic term for a device that is similar to a VCR but records television data in digital format as opposed to the VCR's analog format. VCRs utilize analog tapes to record and play programs broadcast over television, but PVRs encode video data in MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 formats and store the data in a hard drive. PVRs have all of the same functionality of VCRs (recording, playback, fast forwarding, rewinding, pausing) plus the ability to instantly jump to any part of the program without having to rewind or fast forward the data stream.
A PVR is essentially made up of two elements: the device that stores its hardware elements, such as the hard disk drive, power supply and buses, and the software in the form of a subscription service that provides programming information and the ability to encode the data streams.
Two common PVR systems are TiVo and ReplayTV.

personalized_product_recommendations
See under predictive merchandising.

personally_identifiable_information
Abbreviated as PII or pii, personally identifiable information is any information that can identify an individual. This type of information may be requested from users through online forms and can include your mailing address, credit card number, your IP address, phone number, e-mail address, Social Security number or any other unique identifier. Being cautious about the personally identifiable information you provide on the Internet can help reduce the risk of being a victim of identity theft. Also called  personal data. See also "Defend Yourself Against Identity Theft" In Webopedia's "Did You Know" section.

Personas
An extension to the FireFox Web browser that adds custom and personalized themes to the browser. There are two main types of Personas, standard and dynamic.  Standard Personas consist of two image files: a header image that is displayed as the background at the top of the browser window behind the toolbars and tabs, and a footer image that is displayed as the background at the bottom of the browser window where the status bar is located.  Dynamic Personas are also composed of two files (a header and footer). However, they can be of any file format that Firefox can display, including JaveScript and HTML. These Personas can be changed and Firefox will periodically update the content.  See also "All About Web Browsers" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

personnel_security_specialist
In the context of information technology, a personnel security specialist coordinates network security policies to control user access to the network and protect the confidentiality of data. This role requires a deep knowledge of IT security protocols and software. Advanced personnel security specialists design, analyze, and update network security technology to meet a company's evolving personnel security needs.
Other personnel security roles apply technical expertise to law enforcement. For example, the federal government hires personnel security specialists to conduct background checks and process security clearances or to conduct criminal or counterintelligence investigations.
A bachelor's degree in computer science or information systems offers a solid start to a career in personnel security. It's also possible to enter the field with an online IT degree and specialist certification in network security technology. Government personnel security careers may require a law enforcement bachelor's degree.

pervasive_computing
The idea that technology is moving beyond the personal computer to everyday devices with embedded technology and connectivity as computing devices become progressively smaller and more powerful. Also called ubiquitous computing, pervasive computing is the result of computer technology advancing at exponential speeds -- a trend toward all man-made and some natural products having hardware and software. Pervasive computing goes beyond the realm of personal computers: it is the idea that almost any device, from clothing to tools to appliances to cars to homes to the human body to your coffee mug, can be imbedded with chips to connect the device to an infinite network of other devices. The goal of pervasive computing, which combines current network technologies with wireless computing, voice recognition, Internet capability and artificial intelligence, is to create an environment where the connectivity of devices is embedded in such a way that the connectivity is unobtrusive and always available.


Peskyspy
Trojan.Peskyspy is a Trojan horse that has the capability to intercept calls - such as Skype or VoIP calls - record the audio and then store the file locally as an encrypted mp3 file and then relay it back to the cybercriminal. May also be referred to as a wiretap Trojan.

petabyte
It wasn't that long ago that data storage devices were measured in gigabytes and terabyte hard drives seemed exotic. Now that terabytes are commonplace, the next unit of data measurement you're likely to hear about is the petabyte.
In data storage, terms have been defined out to the yottabyte (1024 bytes), or the yobybyte (280 bytes) if you prefer binary to decimal. Having defined those terms, data storage capacities are now working through them one by one. Even PCs have gone from the kilobyte through the megabyte and are now featuring gigabyte RAM and terabyte storage. 
Enterprise storage systems are starting to leave the terabyte behind, moving into petabytes and toward the exabyte stage. A petabyte (PB) is 1015 bytes of data, 1,000 terabytes (TB) or 1,000,000 gigabytes (GB).


petaflop
A petaflop is the ability of a computer to do one quadrillion floating point operations per second (FLOPS). Additionally, a petaflop can be measured as one thousand teraflops.
A petaflop computer requires a massive number of computers working in parallel on the same problem. Applications might include real-time nuclear magnetic resonance imaging during surgery or even astrophysical simulation.
Today's fastest parallel computing operations are capable of petaflop speeds. The world's fastest supercomputer today, Titan, is capable of 20 petaflops.

PEX
PEX is a special dielectric that insulates each conductor from each other to help eliminate noise. It is a technology commonly used in Monster Cable products.

PF
Short for Packet Filter PF is more commonly called the  OpenBSD Packet Filter. Packet Filter is the system used by OpenBSD for filtering TCP/IP traffic and also for doing Network Address Translation (NAT). Packet Filter has been included in the OpenBSD kernel since the release of OpenBSD version 3.0.

PFC
Power factor correction (PFC) is a newer technology used in computer power supplies. PFC is applied to the circuits that include induction motors as a means of reducing the inductive component of the current and thereby reduce the losses in the supply. PFC has no effect on the operation of the motor itself. [Source: Adapted from LM Photonics Ltd]

PGA
)(1) Short for pin grid array, a type of chip package in which the connecting pins are located on the bottom in concentric squares. PGA chips are particularly good for chips that have many pins, such as modern microprocessors. Compare with DIP and SIP.  (2) Short for Professional Graphics Adapter, a video standard developed by IBM that supports 640x480 resolution. 

phablet
A phrase used to describe a half-smartphone and half-tablet mobile device (a phone/tablet hybrid). A phablet is a small pocket-sized mobile device that is a bit larger than the size of an average smartphone, with a touch screen ranging in size from 5 inches (e.g. the Sony Xperia Z) to 6.1 inches (e.g. the Huawei Ascend Mate device). 
While larger than a smartphone, the phablet is much smaller than most tablets and can be held and used in one hand. Phablets typically use 3G or 4G networks for cellular calls and are Wi-Fi-enabled devices.
See also Mobile Operating Systems (Mobile OS) Explained.

phantom-vibrations
A phenomenon in which a person believes their mobile phone is ringing or vibrating against their body when the device isn't actually ringing or vibrating. Also referred to as phantom vibration syndrome or phantom vibration sensations, phantom vibrations and phantom ringing have become quite common in the mobile age with the proliferation of mobile phone use.
In one recent study, nearly 90% of undergraduates surveyed had experienced phantom vibrations at a rate of roughly once every two weeks on average. Also known colloquially by terms such as ringxiety or fauxcellarm, phantom vibration experiences can be disconcerting at times and even bothersome to a small minority of smartphone users, but they are not believed to pose any true health risks.
What Causes Phantom Vibration Sensations?
Phantom vibrations are believed to originate as part of the human brain's ability to attempt to fill in gaps in order to find patterns. Phantom sensations can be triggered when receptors pick up enough physical and/or auditory signals similar to a cell phone's vibrating or ringing alert and then prompt a learned association and the perception of a phone vibration or ringing.

pharming
Similar in nature to email phishing, pharming seeks to obtain personal or private (usually financial related) information through domain spoofing. Rather than being spammed with malicious and mischievous e-mail requests for you to visit spoof Web sites which appear legitimate, pharming 'poisons' a DNS server by infusing false information into the DNS server, resulting in a user's request being redirected elsewhere. Your browser, however will show you are at the correct Web site, which makes pharming a bit more serious and more difficult to detect.
Phishing attempts to scam people one at a time with an e-mail while pharming allows the scammers to target large groups of people at one time through domain spoofing.
See also phishing and spoofing.

phase_change_disk
A type of rewritable optical disk that employs the phase change recording method. Using this technique, the disk drive writes data with a laser that changes spots on the disk between amorphous and crystalline states. An optical head reads data by detecting the difference in reflected light from amorphous and crystalline spots. A medium-intensity pulse can then restore the original crystalline structure.  Magneto-optical and dye-polymer technologies offer similar capabilities for developing re-writable optical disks.  

phase_change_memory
Abbreviated as PCM, phase change memory is a type of non-volatile memory that is much faster than the common flash memory, from 500 to 1,000 times faster, and it also uses up to one half the power. Phase change memory uses a semiconductor alloy that can be changed rapidly between an ordered, crystalline phase having lower electrical resistance to a disordered, amorphous phase with much higher electrical resistance. Because no electrical power is required to maintain either phase of the material, so phase-change memory is non-volatile.

phishing
(fish´ing) (n.) The act of sending an email to a user falsely claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise in an attempt to scam the user into surrendering private information that will be used for identity theft.
Phishing email will typically direct the user to visit a website where they are asked to update personal information, such as a password, credit card, social security, or bank account numbers, that the legitimate organization already has. The website, however, is bogus and will capture and steal any information the user enters on the page.
Examples of Phishing Scams
2003 saw the proliferation of a phishing scam in which users received emails supposedly from eBay claiming that the user's account was about to be suspended unless he clicked on the provided email link and updated the credit card information that the genuine eBay already had. Because it is relatively simple to make a website look like a legitimate organization's site by mimicking the HTML code, the scam counted on people being tricked into thinking they were actually being contacted by eBay and were subsequently going to eBay's site to update their account information.

Phoenix_BIOS
Phoenix Corporation one of the largest producers of BIOS firmware for IBM PC clones. 

phone_home
Phone home is the slang term used to describe a software installation function which will use an Internet connection, if one is found, to send information back to the developer, usually without the users knowledge.

phone_system
A phone system comprises multiple telephones used in an interconnected fashion that allows for advanced telephony features such as call handling and transferring, conference calling, call metering and accounting, private and shared voice message boxes, and so on. A telephone system can range from just a few telephones in a home or small business up to a complex private branch exchange (PBX) system used by mid-sized and large businesses.
Phone systems can function over the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), over the Internet (Internet telephony or VoIP), or over a combination of the two.  Business telephone systems can also be delivered as a hosted service (typically referred to as a centrex), which can free companies from having to invest in costly equipment.
See   The Difference Between VoIP and PSTN Systems in the   Did You Know... section of Webopedia.Also see the   VoIP Meets Wi-Fi article in the   Did You Know? section of Webopedia. 

phonebook
A Google search operator that you can use to restrict Google search to show results only from public U.S. telephone listings. The search engine results page (SERP) will show information including the name, address and phone number for the person you specify. For example, phonebook: John Doe New York NY will show phonebook listings of everyone named John Doe in New York, NY.

photo_illustration
A type of computer art that begins with a digitized photograph. Using special image enhancement software, the artist can then apply a variety of special effects to transform the photo into a work of art.   

photo_scanner
A type of optical scanner designed especially for scanning photographs. Photo scanners are smaller than general-purpose scanners but offer high resolution. A typical photo scanner is a sheet-fed scanner that can scan 3x5-inch or 4x6-inch photographs at 300 dpi or higher resolution. Some high-end photo scanners can also scan negatives and slides. 

PhotoCD
A file format for storing digital photographs developed by Eastman Kodak Co. 

PhotoREt
An HP printing technology that helps provide more vivid prints from digital photos. HP printers that use HP PhotoREt technology have two separate ink cartridges. One tricolor cartridge contains full dye-load inks in cyan, magenta, and yellow while the second ink cartridge contains light dye-load inks of light cyan and light magenta, as well as a specially formulated dye-based black ink. The black ink is richer and glossier than the usual black that is produced by a composite of colored inks. HP PhotoREt IV can produce a total of 289 levels of shade for each color. The complete palette exceeds 1.2 million colors.

photoshopping
A slang term used to describe any image that has been digitally manipulated or altered.

PhotoVCD
A group of images placed on a Video Compact Disc (VCD) and played in a manner similar to a slideshow. To create a PhotoVCD, the images need to be opened in a video editing program, where you can select the order the digital images will be displayed in, as well as optional effects such as music, transition effects (e.g. fade and dissolve), and also decides much time will elapse before the image changes to the next one. The group of images is output like a motion video as a VCD or SVCD.

PHP
Self-referentially short for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, an open source, server-side, HTML embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages.
In an HTML document, PHP script (similar syntax to that of Perl or C ) is enclosed within special PHP tags. Because PHP is embedded within tags, the author can jump between HTML and PHP (similar to ASP and Cold Fusion) instead of having to rely on heavy amounts of code to output HTML. And, because PHP is executed on the server, the clientcannot view the PHP code.
PHP can perform any task that any CGI program can do, but its strength lies in its compatibility with many types of databases. Also, PHP can talk across networks using IMAP, SNMP, NNTP, POP3, or HTTP.

PHP_Pro_Bid
The name of a popular Web-based PHP auction software package. Users can purchase and install PHP Pro Bid to create an online auction Web site that will let members create auction listings, post buy-now items and more. PHP Pro Bid is one of the most popular software packages used by eBay alternatives. PHP Pro Bid is best-suited to Linux or Unix Web servers. However, it can be installed on the majority of Windows servers.

PHP_Voice
Formerly known as PHP VXML, PHP Voice is a framework used in developing developing voice application using PHP. It supports Speech Synthesis Markup Language 1.0, Speech Recognition Grammar Specification 1.0, Voice Browser Call Control: CCXML 1.0, and Voice Extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML) 2.0.

phpAuction
The name of a popular Web-based PHP auction software package. Users can purchase and install phpAuction to create an online auction site in a PHP, MySQL for Unix/Linux environment. The phpAuction software can be deployed on a Web server for online auctions or as stand-alone software for live auctions. The software handles all aspects of conducting an auction. Users can post items for sale in an auction format and others can bid on those items.

phrase_search
A type of search that allows users to search for documents containing an exact sentence or phrase, rather than single keywords. See also keyword search.

phreaking
Closely related to hacking, using a computer or other device to trick a phone system. Typically, phreaking is used to make free calls or to have calls charged to a different account. 

physical
Refers to anything pertaining to hardware. The opposite of physical is logical or virtual, which describe software objects. For example, physical memory  refers to the actual RAM chips installed in a computer. Virtual memory, on the other hand, is an imaginary storage area used by programs.  A physical data structure  refers to the actual organization of data on a storage device. The logical  data structure  refers to how the information appears to a program or user. For example, a data file is a collection of information stored together. This is its logical structure. Physically, however, a file could be stored on a disk in several scattered pieces.   

physical_biometric
A biometric that is based on a physical trait of an individual. Examples of physical biometrics include fingerprints, hand geometry, retinal scans, and DNA. Contrast with  behavioral biometric. See "Defend Yourself Against Identity Theft" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. See also "How Biometrics Security Works" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. Also see "How Fingerprint Scanners Work" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia.

physical_drive
The actual tangible unit of hardware of a disk or tape drive.  Contrast with logical drive.

physical_erase_unit
A flash device is divided into physical erase units. A physical erase unit is the smallest memory area of the flash memory media that can be erased in a single erase operation. Its size varies between flash devices. [Source: msystems]


physical_format
Same as low-level format.

physical_topology
The physical layout of devices on a network. Every LAN has a topology, or the way that the devices on a network are arranged and how they communicate with each other. The way that the workstations are connected to the network through the actual cables that transmit data -- the physical structure of the network -- is called the physical topology. The logical topology, in contrast, is the way that the signals act on the network media, or the way that the data passes through the network from one device to the next without regard to the physical interconnection of the devices.
A network's logical topology is not necessarily the same as its physical topology. For example, twisted pair Ethernet is a logical bus topology in a physical star topology layout. While IBM's Token Ringis a logical ring topology, it is physically set up in a star topology.
For network diagrams, see Network Topology Diagrams in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

PIA
Short for peripheral interface adapter, a specialized interface chip that allows a computer to connect to peripherals such as printers or monitors. The PIA provides two eight-bit ports through which the data passes.

PIC
(1) Short for Lotus Picture File, the graphics file format used to represent graphics generated by Lotus 1-2-3.  (2) Short for  personal Internet communicator. (3) Short for  Programmable Interrupt Controller.

pica
In typesetting, a pica is a unit of measurement equal to 1/6 of an inch, or 12 points.  

picnic
Technical support slang term for problem in chair, not in computer. The term is used to describe a computer user who is the cause of a computer-related problem but insists there is a technical problem with the computer system.

Pico_Projector
A small-format projector that can be used as a standalone projector or as an integrated component in mobile devices, and uses the same technology that powers standard projectors and rear-projection TVs.

picoJava
A low-cost RISC microprocessor dedicated to executing Java -based bytecodes without the need for a interpreter or JIT compiler.  picoJava directly executes the Java Virtual Machine instruction set. As a result, Java software applications are up to 3 times smaller in code size and up to 5 times faster--thus reducing memory requirements--and 20 times faster than Java interpreters running on standard CPU s.   It does not include any memory or I/O interface logic. Rather, developers can add their own logic to customize memory and an interface.  

piconet
A network of devices connected in an ad hoc fashion using Bluetooth technology. A piconet is formed when at least two devices, such as a portable PC and a cellular phone, connect. A piconet can support up to eight devices. When a piconet is formed, one device acts as the master while the others act as slaves for the duration of the piconet connection. A piconet is sometimes called a PAN.  "Piconet" is a combination of the prefix "pico," meaning very small or one trillionth, and network.

PICT_file_format
A file format developed by Apple Computer in 1984. PICT files are encoded in QuickDraw commands and can hold both object-oriented images and bit-mapped images. It is supported by all graphics  programs that run on Macintosh computers.  The original PICT format supported 8 colors. Modern versions of PICT, including PICT2, support 32-bit color (more than 16 million colors). 

PictBridge
PictBridge is a technology that lets you print directly from your digital camera to the  printer without using a computer to handle the data transfer in between. Some manufactures offer direct printing for their own proprietary devices (for example, the ability to print from a Canon digital camera to a Canon printer with the aid of USB hook-up), but PictBridge is an industry standard rather than  proprietary technology, meaning you could connect one manufacturer's camera to another manufacturer's printer for direct printing if they both support PictBridge. PictBridge compatible devices offer camera-to-printer connecting, single-image printing, and uniform error messages.

PID
Short for process identifier, also called a  process ID. It refers to the number assigned to a process by the operating system to uniquely identify a process running on a system.

Pidgin
Formerly called Gaim, Pidgin is an open source, a graphical multiheaded IM program for Linux, BSD, MacOS X and Windows multi-IM client that works similar to Trillian. Pidgin is compatible with many chat networks including; AIM, ICQ, Google Talk, Jabber/XMPP, MSN Messenger, Yahoo, Bonjour, Gadu-Gadu, IRC, Novell GroupWise Messenger, QQ, Lotus Sametime, SILC, SIMPLE, MySpaceIM, and Zephyr. It can support additional networks with the use of plug-ins. Pidgin supports many features of these chat networks, such as file transfers, away messages, buddy icons, custom smilies, and typing notifications. Numerous plug-ins also extend Pidgin's functionality above and beyond the standard features. Pidgin is free and contains no ads. The code is open source and licensed under the GNU General Public License. See "A Quick Reference to Consumer Instant Messaging" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

pie_chart
)A type of presentation graphic in which percentage values are represented as proportionally-sized slices of a pie. 

Pierre_Salinger_Syndrome
The tendency for one to believe that everything he reads on the Internet is true. Named for the former White House press secretary and journalist Pierre Salinger who reportedly relayed a bogus report that he read on the Internet, stating that TWA flight 800, which crashed on July 17, 1996, had been the victim of friendly fire. Salinger, in fact, did not get his information from the Internet but from reputable security agents who were incorrect.

PIF_file
Short for Program Information file, a type of file that holds information about how Windows should run a non-Windows application. For example, a PIF file can contain instructions for executing a DOS application in the Windows environment. These instructions can include the amount of memory to use, the path to the executable file, and what type of window to use. PIF files have a .pif extension .


piggyback_e_mail
Piggyback e-mail is a term used in the e-mail marketing industry. A piggyback e-mail is comprised of a third-party advertisement embedded in the body of a e-mail sent to an opt-in subscription e-mail list that is comprised of demographics of target consumers the third-party want to advertise to.  In this instance, the e-mail containing the advertisement comes from the list owner, not directly from the advertiser. See also solus e-mail.

PII
The Pentium II builds on the design of the Pentium Pro, but adds an additional 2 million transistors to bring the total up to 7.5 million. Current versions of the chip run at speeds of 233, 266, 300, and 333 MHz. In addition, the Pentium II features the following:  A Singled Edge Contact (SEC) cartridge that fits into Slot 1 Dual Independent Bus (DIB) architecture 512K L2 cache 32K L1 cache MMX support   

pii-personally-identifiable-information
Personally Identifiable Information, or PII, refers to information or data that can be used to discover or distinguish an individual's identity and specific details about the individual. While definitions for PII vary slightly, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) specifically defines personally identifiable information as:
"any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information."
Protecting Personally Identifiable Information
Also referred to as personal identifiable information, PII has become increasingly relevant in recent years as privacy laws and regulations have become more stringent for enterprises. As a result, IT departments are tasked with assessing and addressing the specific risks that an individual can be identified when corporate information is made publicly available, including when that information might be combined with other available information that could be used to identify an individual.
Compromised personal identifiable information carries the possibility of causing substantial harm to individuals in the form of identity theft or other fraudulent use of their personal information, and enterprises are now required to take all necessary measures to safeguard this sensitive information to protect their customers and employees and prevent being liable for compromised PII.

PIM
Abbreviated PIM, a type of software application designed to help users organize random bits of information. Although the category is fuzzy, most PIMs enable you to enter various kinds of textual notes -- reminders, lists, dates -- and to link these bits of information together in useful ways. Many PIMs also include calendar, scheduling, and calculator programs.

pin
(1) In dot-matrix printers, the devices that press on the ink ribbon to make dots on the paper. Printers are classified by how many pins they have on the printer head. The more pins a printer has, the higher-quality type it is capable of producing. Dot-matrix printers can have anywhere from 9 to 24 pins. A 24-pin printer can produce letter-quality print.  (2) A male lead on a connector.  (3) Silicon chips have an array of thin metal feet (pins) on their underside that enables them to be attached to a circuit board. The pins are very delicate and easily bent. If they are damaged, the chip will not sit correctly and will malfunction.  

pincushion_distortion
A common type of distortion in CRT monitors in which horizontal and vertical lines bend inwards toward the center of the display. The distortion is most noticeable at the edges of the display.  The opposite of pincushion distortion is barrel distortion, in which horizontal and vertical lines bend outwards toward the edge of the display. A third type of distortion, called trapezoid distortion, occurs when vertical lines are straight but not parallel with each other.  Most monitors have pincushion/barrel controls that let you correct these distortions, and many monitors also include a trapezoid distortion control.  

PINE
Acronym for pine is not elm or Program for Internet News and E-Mail, a character-based e-mail client for UNIX systems. Developed at the University of Washington, PINE replaces an older e-mail program called elm. 

PING
A utility to determine whether a specific IP address is accessible. It works by sending a packet to the specified address and waiting for a reply. PING is used primarily to troubleshoot Internet connections. There are many freeware and sharewarePing utilities available for personal computers.
It is often believed that "Ping" is an abbreviation for Packet Internet Groper, but Ping's author has stated that the names comes from the sound that a sonar makes.

ping_of_death
(ping &v deth) (n.) A type of DoS attack in which the attacker sends a ping request that is larger than 65,536 bytes, which is the maximum size that IP allows. While a ping larger than 65,536 bytes is too large to fit in one packet that can be transmitted, TCP/IP allows a packet to be fragmented, essentially splitting the packet into smaller segments that are eventually reassembled. Attacks took advantage of this flaw by fragmenting packets that when received would total more than the allowed number of bytes and would effectively cause a buffer overload on the operating system at the receiving end, crashing the system.  Ping of death attacks are rare today as most operating systems have been fixed to prevent this type of attack from occurring.

ping_triangulation
A process developed by IBM in which client requests over the Internet can be routed to the cell that is geographically closest. When one or more mirror sites exists, ping triangulation uses a process called echo location. When a server receives a client request, it sends out an ICMP echo, or ping, packet across the Internet to the mirror sites and times the echo response. From this information, the most appropriate site to respond to the client request is determined. Basically, ping triangulation maps in multidimensional space the location of every mirror site and the end-user, sending that user not only to an open server but to the closest open server.

pink_contract
A slang term used to describe a special contract between an ISP and a customer whereby the ISP will permit that customer to send unsolicited email (spam) or setup a spam-like website.
 
See also "PSINet assailed as spam contract surfaces" on cnet news.

pinned_item_list
The list of programs on the Start menu in the Microsoft Windows OS is divided into two parts: the programs displayed above the separator line (also known as the pinned items list) and the programs displayed below the separator line (also known as the most frequently used programs list). The programs on the pinned items list remain there and are always available for you to click to start them. You can add programs to the pinned items list. * * [Source: Microsoft Web site -  Start menu overview] 

pinout
A diagram or table that describes the purpose of each pin in a chip or connector, or each wire in a cable. 

pinterest
The name of a social networking site that lets people share images and videos from their own personal media collection or from websites they visit. Pinterest was launched in 2009 by Cold Brew Labs Inc., and was co-founded by Ben Silbermann, a former Google employee.
Pinterest uses a system of "boards" which is a collection of photos on any topic you choose to pin about.  On the Pinterest website the word pin is used to mean any image added to Pinterest, while the word board means a set of pins.
You can follow boards when you find one that is of interest and be notified when it's updated. You will also receive a notification when another Pinterest users "repins" from your board. You can browse, pin and repin from any mobile or PC browser. A Pinterest app for the Apple iPhone is also available.

pinwheel_of_death
The Spinning Pinwheel of Death (SPoD) is Mac OS X’s version of Windows’ Blue Screen of Death (BSoD).  Officially referred to as the "Spinning Wait Cursor" by Apple, the Pinwheel of Death occurs when the multicolored pinwheel mouse pointer that signifies an application has stopped responding to the system continues to spin without end. 
In most cases, the Pinwheel of Death is trigger by an application-specific issue and can be resolved by force quitting the application responsible for the problem, although in more severe cases where the entire system locks up a hard reboot or even a complete system restore may be necessary.
The Pinwheel of Death may also be referred to as the spinning wheel, the Beach Ball of Death (BBoD), the spinning rainbow of death, the rainbow wheel or the spinning pizza.

PIO
Short for Programmed Input/Output, a method of transferring data between two devices that uses the computer's main processor as part of the data path. ATA uses PIO and defines the speed of the data transfer in terms of the PIO mode implemented, as shown below:  PIO ModeData Transfer Rate (MBps) Standard 03.3ATA  15.2ATA  28.3ATA  311.1ATA-2  416.6ATA-2     

PIP
Acronym for picture-in-picture, PIP is a feature on some televisions and most HDTV sets that allows you to see a second program inside a small window on your television, allowing you to watch two programs at once.

pipa
PIPA, the PROTECT IP Act (Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act) is an amendment/re-write of the failed Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA). Under the proposed law, PIPA, would give the government and copyright holders tools to prevent access to rogue websites that are dedicate to counterfeit goods or infringe the intellectual property act.  The bill was introduced on May 12, 2011 by Senator Patrick Leahy.
On January 18, 2012, several thousand websites opposing the law, including Reddit, Boing Boing, Wired, WordPress, Wikipedia and Mozilla Firefox launched a service blackout in protest of PIPA and another controversial bill, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). During the service outage, participating websites left readers with information about SOPA and PIPA, citing examples of what "could" happen if the SOPA/PIPA bills were passed.
See also SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) and OPEN (Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act).

pipe
)A temporary software connection between two programs or commands. Normally, the operating system accepts input from the keyboard and sends output to the display screen. Sometimes, however, it is useful to use the output from one command as the input for a second command, without passing the data through the keyboard or display screen. Pipes were invented for these situations.  One of the best examples of pipe usage is linking the command that lists files in a directory to a command that sorts data. By piping the two commands together, you can display the files in sorted order. In UNIX and DOS, the pipe symbol is a vertical bar (|). The DOS command to list files in alphabetical order, therefore, would be:  DIR | SORT  

pipeline_burst_cache
A type of memory cache built into many modern DRAM controller and chipset designs. Pipeline burst caches use two techniques - a burst mode that pre-fetches memory contents before they are requested, and pipelining so that one memory value can be accessed in the cache at the same time that another memory value is accessed in DRAM. The purpose of pipeline burst caches is to minimize wait states so that memory can be accessed as fast a possible by the microprocessor.  The term is often abbreviated as PBC. 

pipelining
(n.) (1) A technique used in advanced microprocessors where the microprocessor begins executing a second instruction before the first has been completed. That is, several instructions are in the pipeline simultaneously, each at a different processing stage.
The pipeline is divided into segments and each segment can execute its operation concurrently with the other segments. When a segment completes an operation, it passes the result to the next segment in the pipeline and fetches the next operation from the preceding segment. The final results of each instruction emerge at the end of the pipeline in rapid succession.
Although formerly a feature only of high-performance and RISC -based microprocessors, pipelining is now common in microprocessors used in personal computers. Intel's Pentium chip, for example, uses pipelining to execute as many as six instructions simultaneously.

pit
The recessed area on a CD or DVD where data is stored. CDs and DVDs store data in lands and pits. The lands represent 1 and the pits represent 0 in binary computing. The bits are read by the disc drive that uses a laser beam to distinguish between the lands and pits based on the amount of scattering or deflection that occurs when the beam of light hits the surface of the disc.

pitch
(1) For fixed-pitch (or monospaced) fonts, pitch refers to the number of characters printed per inch. Pitch is one characteristic of a monospaced font. Common pitch values are 10 and 12.  In proportional-pitch fonts, different characters have different widths, depending on their size. For example, the letter d would be wider than the letter I. Proportional fonts, therefore, have no pitch value.  (2) In graphics, dot pitch refers to the spacing between pixels on a monitor. The smaller the dot pitch, the sharper the image.   

piwik_web_analytics
Piwik is a free and open source Web analytics software program. The program provides detailed reports on your website traffic, including popular reports such as the search engines and keywords visitors used to find your page, the language they speak, your popular pages and other analytical reports.
Piwik is a PHP MySQL software program that Web publishers need to download and install on your own Web server. After the initial set-up a JavaScript code is provided that you must copy and paste on any websites you want to track using the Piwik Web analytics software.

PIX_Firewall
Short for Private Internet Exchange Firewall, a firewall protection technology developed by Cisco Systems.

pixel
Short for Picture Element, a pixel is a single point in a graphic image. Graphics monitors display pictures by dividing the display screen into thousands (or millions) of pixels, arranged in rows and columns. The pixels are so close together that they appear connected.
The number of bits used to represent each pixel determines how many colors or shades of gray can be displayed. For example, in 8-bit color mode, the color monitoruses 8 bits for each pixel, making it possible to display 2 to the 8th power (256) different colors or shades of gray.
On color monitors, each pixel is actually composed of three dots -- a red, a blue, and a green one. Ideally, the three dots should all converge at the same point, but all monitors have some convergenceerror that can make color pixels appear fuzzy.

pixel_pipelines
The part of a video card that transfers pixel information. The amount of pixel pipelines a graphics card has can have a great impact on the speed of the image rendering. The more pixel pipelines, the faster the video card can process pixels. A card with eight pipelines can process twice as many pixels as a card of the same speed with four pipelines.

Pixel_Shader
The name used to describe the method in which a GPU applies textures and renders pixels to the display. Pixel Shaders are used to give a more realistic look to objects, such as reflections.

pixel_tag
Also called a Web bug or a pixel tag or a clear GIF. Used in combination with cookies, a Web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, that is placed on a Web site or in an e-mail that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the Web site or sending the e-mail. When the HTML code for the Web beacon points to a site to retrieve the image, at the same time it can pass along information such as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the Web beacon was viewed and for how long, the type of browser that retrieved the image and previously set cookie values.
Web beacons are typically used by a third party to monitor the activity of a site. A Web beacon can be detected by viewing the source code of a Web page and looking for any IMG tags that load from a different server than the rest of the site. Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent Web beacons from tracking the user's activity. The Web beacon will still account for an anonymous visit, but the user's unique information will not be recorded.

pixelated
(adj.) (1) Describes an image in which individual pixels are apparent to the naked eye. Typically, the separate square pixels in bitmapped images such as GIFs do not appear individually. When the image is displayed too large or at a low resolution the image becomes pixelated (this is sometimes done purposely for special effect).
(2) Describes an image that has been converted from print to a digitized image, such as a GIF.
The term should not be confused with pixilated, which means whimsical and bemused.

PKI
Short for public key infrastructure, a system of digital certificates, Certificate Authorities, and other registration authorities that verify and authenticate the validity of each party involved in an Internet transaction. PKIs are currently evolving and there is no single PKI nor even a single agreed-upon standard for setting up a PKI. However, nearly everyone agrees that reliable PKIs are necessary before electronic commerce can become widespread.  A PKI is also called a trust hierarchy. 

PKZIP
One of the most widely used file compression methods. PKZIP was developed by PKWARE, Inc. in 1989 and distributed as shareware. Files that have been compressed using PKWARE are said to be zipped. Decompressing them is called unzipping.
The PK stands for Phillip Katz, the author of the programs.

PL_B
Short for Programming Language for Business, PL/B is an English-like high-level programming language that offers screen, file and character string manipulation. The PL/B source code will  compile and run without changes across multiple  platforms and it incorporates strong file access capabilities that distinguish it from other languages. PL/B is also multi-user friendly, as no additional code is required for files to be shared among many users.  PL/B was formerly called DATABUS and designed by Datapoint in the early 1970s. It was originally considered an alternative to  COBOL.

PL_SQL
Short for Procedural Language/SQL, Oracle��s procedural extension to the industry-standard SQL. By adding procedural constructs to SQL, such as encapsulation, function overloading, information hiding, block structure, conditional statements, loop statements, variable types, structured data and customized error handling, the PL/SQL language takes on characteristics of object-oriented programming languages. PL/SQL's language syntax, structure and data types are similar to that of the Ada programming language. Integrated with a database server, PL/SQL does not exist as a standalone language. It typically is used to write data-centric programs to manipulate data in an Oracle database.

plain_text
Refers to textual data in ASCII format. Plain text is the most portable format because it is supported by nearly every application on every machine. It is quite limited, however, because it cannot contain any formatting commands.  In cryptography, plain text refers to any message that is not encrypted. Contrast with cipher text.  Plain text is also called clear text.  

plasma_display
A type of flat-panel display that works by sandwiching a neon/xenon gas mixture between two sealed glass plates with parallel electrodes deposited on their surfaces. The plates are sealed so that the electrodes form right angles, creating pixels. When a voltage pulse passes between two electrodes, the gas breaks down and produces weakly ionized plasma, which emits UV radiation. The UV radiation activates color phosphors and visible light is emitted from each pixel.   Today, Plasma displays are becoming more and more popular. Compared to conventional CRT displays, plasma displays are about one-tenth the thickness--around 4'', and one-sixth the weight--under 67 pounds for a 40" display. They use over 16 million colors and have a 160 degree-viewing angle.   Plasma displays are manufactured by companies such as Panasonic, Fujitsu, and Pioneer.  

plasma_TV
Plasma TV's create a picture from a gas (plasma) filled with xenon and neon atoms and millions of electrically charged atoms and electrons, that collide when you turn the power on. The energy the collision releases increases the energy level in the plasma and the neon and xenon release photons of light (similar to the way neon lights work). Plasma TVs offer large viewing areas (up to 50 inches) but are very thin. While they offer excellent picture quality, they are quite expensive and are fast becoming the popular choice for HDTV. See also plasma display.

plastic_optical_fiber
Abbreviated as POF, plastic optical fiber is a type of optical fiber that uses polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) as the core material that allows the transmission of light. POF is often called consumer optical fiber as it is a low-cost optical fiber alternative that is easier to use than glass optical fiber. It sustains a data transfer speed of 2.5GB/s, which isn't as fast as glass optical fiber, but is much faster than traditional copper wire.
In comparison to traditional optical fiber, PoF is much larger in diameter which results in lower data rates making it most suitable for high bandwidth signal transmission over short distances. Unlike glass, plastic fiber can easily be cut and bent to fit in hard-to-reach places and the larger core also allows for slightly damaged fiber to work. POF products are most commonly used in medical, automotive, home networks, as well as digital audio and video interfaces.
See also fiber optics.

platform
The underlying hardware or software for a system. For example, the platform might be an Intel 80486 processor running DOS Version 6.0. The platform could also be UNIX machines on an Ethernet network.
The platform defines a standard around which a system can be developed. Once the platform has been defined, software developers can produce appropriate software and managers can purchase appropriate hardware and applications. The term is often used as a synonym of operating system.
The term cross-platform refers to applications, formats, or devices that work on different platforms. For example, a cross-platform programming   environment  enables a programmer to develop programs for many platforms at once.

platform_security
A security model that is used to protect an entire  platform and secures the entire span of software or devices on that platform, removing the need to incorporate individual or multiple security measures for different programs on the system. Security at the platform level makes the security process simplified for IT and developers. However, once the security is cracked the entire platform is vulnerable. Trusted Platform Module, designed to secure an entire notebook is a type of platform security.
 
 

platter
(n.) A round magnetic plate that constitutes part of a hard disk. Hard disks typically contain up to a dozen platters. Most platters require two read/write heads, one for each side. Also see What's Inside a Hard Drive? in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia.

Play_To
A feature in Microsoft's Windows 7 operating system that enables users to play media, including music, photos, and videos from your PC to any devices that are connected on the network. To use the Play To feature, users can right-click the files on their computer, and choose "Play To" and select the device you want to stream the media files to.

playback_control
Abbreviated as PBC, playback control is a way top control disc play on VCDs. Playback control allows users to interact with the disc through menus.

PLC
(1) Short for power line communications, the use of the existing utility power grid as the medium to send broadband data communications. In theory, plugging a computer device into an existing power outlet would connect the user to the Internet by tapping into already established national and global power grid networks.  Power grids typically transmit electricity in three levels of voltage: low, medium and high. Medium voltage, typically ranging in the tens of thousands of volts, is what a utility substation will bring to a transformer, and the transformer will reduce the voltage into the low range before sending the electricity into a building. It is the low and medium voltages that PLC takes advantage of in order to transmit data at Ethernet-like speeds.  Some problems associated with the technology include no global technology standard, the different power usages of different countries, and the amount of noise that electronic equipment already produces on power lines.  PLC has applications in expansive networking, such as MANs or CANs, and smaller networking architectures, such as LANs and home networking. (2) Short for product life cycle it is a marketing theory which dictates the the sequence of events, or lifespan divisions of any marketed product or brand, including technologies, consumer goods, and any item which is marketed to the public and sold at retail outlets on a national basis. Typically the PLC consists of four stages; introduction, growth, maturity and sales decline.

PLCC
Short for Plastic Leaded Chip Carrier, a square surface-mount chip package for low thermal output microprocessors that substitutes epoxy plastic for the ceramic materials that are commonly used to encase chips in systems designed for microprocessors that produce high thermal outputs that can melt the plastic epoxy. Unlike pin grid arrays , the die in a PLCC is attached to the package by a gold-plated contact pad.

PLD
Short for programmable logic device, a generic term for an integrated circuit that can be programmed in a laboratory to perform complex functions. A PLD consists of arrays of AND and OR gates. A system designer implements a logic design with a device programmer that blows fuses on the PLD to control gate operation.  System designers can use development software that converts basic code into instructions a device programmer needs to implement a design.  PLD types can classified into the following groups  PROMs (Programmable Read Only Memory) - offer high speed and low cost for relatively small designs PLAs (Programmable Logic Array) - offer flexible features for more complex designs PAL/GALs (Programmable Array Logic/Generic Array Logic) - offer good flexibility and are faster and less expensive than PLAs   

PLED
Short for polymer, or polymeric, light-emitting diode, a backlighting, illumination and display technology. Polymers are substances formed by a chemical reaction in which two or more molecules combine to form larger molecules. PLEDs are thin film displays that are created by sandwiching an undoped conjugated polymer between two proper electrodes at a short distance. The polymer emits light when exposed to electricity. PLEDs enable full-spectrum color displays and are relatively inexpensive compared to other display technologies such as LCD or OLED and require little power to emit a substantial amount of light.

plenum_cable
Cable that is run in the plenum spaces of buildings. In building construction, the plenum (pronounced PLEH-nuhm) is the space that is used for air circulation in heating and air conditioning systems, typically between the structural ceiling and the suspended ceiling or under a raised floor. The plenum space is typically used to house the communication cables for the buildings computer and telephone network(s). However, use of plenum areas for cable storage poses a serious hazard in the event of a fire as once the fire reaches the plenum space there are few barriers to contain the smoke and flames. Plenum cable is coated with a fire-retardant coating (usually Teflon) so that in case of a fire it does not give off toxic gasses and smoke as it burns. Twisted-pair and coaxial versions of cable are made in plenum versions.

Pliant
An open source dynamically compiled language with a trivial syntax in which advanced features can be written in the language itself, as modules. Modules in Pliant consist of normal library routines or meta-programming functions. Pliant can run as an application under any Linux distribution, as an application under the Windows operating system, or as a standalone operating system named FullPliant.  Pliant provides programmers with a complete development environment including the dynamic compiler, debugging an profiling features, a database engine, a Web friendly user interface graphical toolkit, client and server side implementations of several standard services, and more. Pliant is released under the GNU public license, version 2.Learn more about  Open Source in Webopedia's "Did You Know...?" section.

PLL
Short for phase-locked loop, an electronic circuit that controls an oscillator so that it maintains a constant phase angle (i.e., lock) on the frequency of an input, or reference, signal. A PLL ensures that a communication signal is locked on a specific frequency and can also be used to generate, modulate and demodulate a signal and divide a frequency.  PLL is used often in wireless communications where the oscillator is usually at the receiver and the input signal is extracted from the signal received from the remote transmitter.

PLM
Short for Product Lifecycle Management, it refers to a set of software tools used for mechanical design, analysis and manufacturing to support products from when they are first conceived through distribution and retirement. *PLM is assembled from various software programs, rather than purchased outright as a single commercial off-the-shelf product. Once assembled, a well-designed PLM system will manage product specifications and formulas, provide production histories, create complete product genealogies, and track total product quality. [* Adapted from EnteGreat]

PLMN
Short for public land mobile network, a generic term for a mobile wireless network that is centrally operated and administrated by an organization and uses land-based radio frequency transmitters or base stations as network hubs. PLMNs can stand alone and interconnect with one another or connect to a fixed system such as the PSTN.
Cellular phones and mobile Internet access are two common uses of a PLMN.

plog
(n.) A  slang term used to mean a political blog-a  blog about politics.  (v.) To author a political blog.   Other forms: plogger (a person who blogs about politics).  See "The History of Blogging" in the  Quick Reference section of Webopedia. 

plot
To produce an image by drawing lines. You can program a computer to plot images on a display screen or on paper.   

plotter
)A device that draws pictures on paper based on commands from a computer. Plotters differ from printers in that they draw lines using a pen. As a result, they can produce continuous lines, whereas printers can only simulate lines by printing a closely spaced series of dots. Multicolor plotters use different-colored pens to draw different colors.
In general, plotters are considerably more expensive than printers. They are used in engineering applications where precision is mandatory.


plug
A connector used to link together devices.  

plug_compatible
Able to replace another product without any alterations. Two devices are said to be plug-compatible if either one can be plugged into the same interface. The term is also sometimes used to describe software modules that interface with an application in the same way.  

plug_and_play
Refers to the ability of a computer system to automatically configure expansion boards and other devices. You should be able to plug in a device and play with it, without worrying about setting DIP switches, jumpers, and other configuration elements. Since the introduction of the NuBus, the Apple Macintosh has been a plug-and-play computer.

plug_in
(n.) A hardware or software module that adds a specific feature or service to a larger system. The idea is that the new component simply plugs in to the existing system. For example, there are number of plug-ins for the Netscape Navigator browser that enable it to display different types of audio or video messages. Navigator plug-ins are based on MIME file types. 

pluggable_authentication_module
A UNIX programming interface that enables third-party security methods to be used. By using PAM, multiple authentication technologies, such as RSA, DCE, Kerberos, smart card and S/Key, can be added without changing any of the login services, thereby preserving existing system environments.

PMMA
Short for polymethylmethacrylate, or more correctly Poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA is a clear plastic acrylic material that can be used as a replacement for glass. PMMA is commonly used in places where shatter-proof glass or windows are required, such as the puck barriers found in hockey rinks. PMMA is also used in signs, lenses, paints and it is also the core material used in plastic optical fiber.

PMML
A standard developed by the Data Mining Group (DMG) to represent predictive  analytic models. Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) is supported by  leading  business intelligence and analytics vendors like IBM, SAS, MicroStrategy, Oracle and SAP.
The XML-based PMML enables  sharing predictive analytic models between different applications,  making it possible, for example, to build a model in one system and then move it  to another system to test its performance against a test data set.
The  latest version of PMML, 4.0, was released on June 16, 2009.

PMP
Acronym for Portable Music Player.
PMP describes any digital portable music player which allows users to download or save digital music files (in MP3 format) from their computer to play on their PMP. Some examples of a PMP would be the iPod, iRiver, Rio Karma, and the NOMAD to name a few.
See also  The Difference between an iPod vs. MP3 Player in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia.

PMPO
Acronym for peak momentary power output. 
This term refers to the maximum power output achieved for a speaker system under perfect conditions. PMPO is a controversy term, as many feel it is used as a marketing ploy, since the perfect conditions on which PMPO are based are next to impossible to achieve in a home where the speaker system is set up. The PMPO of a speaker is actually based on the maximum power output in a very small period of time (microseconds). Since no musical note lasts for such a short amount of time this peak performance cannot be reproduced in real usage of the speaker. The PMPO value is often seen listed as "watts PMPO" on product packaging. PMPO is also called peak music power output.
The alternative to PMPO is RMS (Root Mean Square), which is an accurate mathematical representation of a speaker's power output, measured over time rather than a few microseconds.

Pantone_Matching_System_PMS
A popular color matching system used by the printing industry to print spot colors. Most applications that support color printing allow you to specify colors by indicating the Pantone name or number. This assures that you get the right color when the file is printed, even though the color may not look right when displayed on your monitor.
PMS works well for spot colors but not for process colors, which are generally specified using the CMYK color model.

pNFS
Short for parallel Network File System, pNFS is a protocol extension of NFS 4.1, the first major performance upgrade to the widely deployed NFS in more than a decade. pNFS provides parallel I/O to file systems accessible over NFS to eliminate performance bottlenecks. With pNFS clients can directly access storage devices in parallel.  metadata processing. pNFS moves the metadata server out of the data transfer path, boosting performance by allowing multiple disk drives to serve up data in parallel. pNFS let's storage administrators do things, such as stripe a single file across multiple NFS servers (essentially the same as RAID0), which boosts performance by allowing multiple disk drives to serve up data in parallel. pNFS takes this concept and extends it to multiple storage devices connected to the NFS client over a network. See also "NFS Enters a Parallel Universe" on EnterpriseStorageForum.com

PNG
Short for Portable Network Graphics, and pronounced ping, a new bit-mapped graphics format similar to GIF. In fact, PNG was approved as a standard by the World Wide Web consortium to replace GIF because GIF uses a patented data compression algorithm called LZW. In contrast, PNG is completely patent- and license-free. The most recent versions of Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer now support PNG. Also see JPG vs. GIF vs. PNG in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia. 

PnP
Short for Plug and Play, a technology developed by Microsoft and Intel that supports plug-and-play installation. Microsoft has made PnP technology a part of its operating systems since Windows 95.

POC
Push-to-talk Over Cellular (POC) is the push to talk (PTT) voice service for mobile communications. It provides direct one-to-one and one-to-many voice communication service in the cellular network. It is based on half-duplex VoIP technology over mobile networks which allows PTT service to use cellular access resources. See also PTT.

pocket_dial
A pocket dial (also called pocket call, butt dial or butt call) is a slang term used to mean an unintentional call placed from a mobile phone because the send button was accidentally pressed while carrying the phone in your pocket.  The word pocket in text message slang is "pocko" and this may also be used in texting as the shortened version of pocket dial.

Pocket_PC
A common name for Windows Mobile PDA devices, Pocket PCs usually offer smaller versions of Microsoft applications such as Word and Outlook. synchronization is done between the device and a Windows-based computer system.

PocketTweets
The name of a mobile Web-based Twitter client for the iPhone. You can use it to see the latest tweets from your contacts or to update your status remotely. See "Social Media Tips for Online Marketing Plus 30 Social Media Sites" in the Did You Know...? section of Webopedia.

POD
Also called point of demarcation (POD), demarc extension, or demarc, it is the physical point at which the public network of a telecommunications company (i.e., a phone or cable company) ends and the private network of a customer begins - this is usually where the cable physically enters a building.
For example, if your business subscribes to receive Internet through a local phone or cable company, the provider installs a demarcation point at your business. The demarc is usually a grey box mounted on the outside of the building. On the outside of the building the provider's wires run in to the demarc (overhead or underground). The wires are switched at the Demarc and are then run into the physical building. For residential services, the demarc is often installed inside the residence in the homeowner's cellar or basement.

podcasting
Podcasting is similar in nature to RSS, which allows subscribers to subscribe to a set of feeds to view syndicated Web site content. With podcasting however, you have a set of subscriptions that are checked regularly for updates and instead of reading the feeds on your computer screen, you listen  to the new content on on your iPod (or like device).The format used for podcasting is RSS 2.0 with enclosures. The podcasting enclosures refer to all binary (non-text) downloads. You can read the text description of the enclosure before downloading the item to view.

PoE
Short for Power over Ethernet, a solution where electrical current is run to networking hardware over the Ethernet Category 5 or higher data cabling. No extra AC power cord is needed at the product location, minimizing the amount of cables needed and/or the hassle of installing extra outlets.

point
)(v) To move the pointer on a display screen to select an item. Graphical user interfaces, such as the Macintosh interface, are often called point-and-click interfaces because a user typically points to an object on the screen and then clicks a button on the mouse.  (n) In typography, a point is about 1/72 of an inch and is used to measure the height of characters. (Historically, a point was.0138 inches, a little less than 1/72 of an inch, but this has changed.)  The height of the characters is one characteristic of fonts. Some fonts are referred to as fixed-point fonts because their representation allows for only one size. In contrast, a scalable font is one that is represented in such a way that the size can easily be changed. 

point_and_shoot
A type of digital camera (or camera setting) that offers users no additional manual settings or options. With point and shoot the camera focus, flash and all settings are automatically set by the camera enabling users to simply point the camera at the subject and press the shutter button. See also "The Digital Camera Picture" in  Webopedia's Quick Reference section.

point_of_sale
Point of sale, or POS as it is more commonly abbreviated, refers to the capturing of data and customer payment information at a physical location when goods or services are bought and sold. The POS transaction is captured using a variety of devices which include computers, cash registers, optical and bar code scanners, magnetic card readers, or any combination of these devices.

point_to_point_videoconference
A videoconferencing which takes between two sites.

PointCast
A now-defunct company founded in 1992 to deliver news and other information over Internet connections. PointCast's flagship product was PointCast Network, which sent customized news to users' desktops. PointCast Network was free. To use it, you needed to download the PointCast client program, which was available from PointCast's Web site and many other places.  PointCast was the first company to successfully combine the Internet with push technologies.  In 1999 EntryPoint acquired PointCast, and in late 2000 EntryPoint merged with Internet Financial Network Inc. to form InfoGate. 

pointcuts
In aspect-oriented programming (AOP), pointcuts define the points in your model where advice will be applied.

pointer
)(1) In graphical user interfaces, a pointer is a small arrow or other symbol on the display screen that moves as you move the mouse. You can select commands and options by positioning the tip of the arrow over the desired choice and clicking a mouse button. Many text processing programs use an I-beam pointer.  Pointers are often referred to as mouse  pointers.  (2) A variable that contains the address of a location in memory. The location is the starting point of an allocated object, such as an object or value type, or the element of an array.

pointing_device
A device with which you can control the movement of the pointer to select items on a display screen. Examples of pointing devices include mice, trackballs, joysticks, touchpads, and light pens.  

pointing_stick
A pointing device first developed by IBM for its notebook computers that consists of a miniature joystick, usually with a rubber eraser-head tip, positioned somewhere between the keys on the keyboard. Most pointing sticks are pressure-sensitive, so the pointer moves faster when more pressure is applied.  

POJI
Short for plain old java interface. It is used to enforce the idea of developing an API against interfaces instead of implementations. See also POJO.

POJO
Acronym for Plain Old Java Object. POJO, or Plain Old Java Object, is a normal Java object class (that is, not a JavaBean, EntityBean etc.)  and does not serve any other special role nor does it implement any special interfaces of any of the Java frameworks. This term was coined by Martin Fowler, Rebbecca Parsons and Josh MacKenzie who believed that by creating the acronym POJO, such objects would have a "fancy name", thereby convincing people that they were worthy of use.

polarizer
A lens filter commonly used in photography and digital photography that polarizes the light as it enters the camera lens. Polarizers can be used to help darken a bright sky or remove reflections and glare from objects. Also called a polarizing filter.

policy_awareness
A function of information systems that provides users of that specific system with accessible, understandable views of the policies associated with information resources. Policy awareness provides representations of policies in order to facilitate compliance with stated rules, and enables accountability when rules are intentionally or accidentally broken.

polling
(1) Polling is a CAM. In a master/slave scenario, the master queries each slave device in turn as to whether it has any data to transmit. If the slave answers yes then the device is permitted to transmit its data. If the slave answers no then the master moves on and polls the next slave device. The process is repeated continuously. Also see contention and token passing.  (2) Making continuous requests for data from another device. For example, modems that support polling can call another system and request data.

polyfont_recognition
A commonly used term in conjunction with OCR  software. Polyfont recognition refers to the capability of computer software, usually OCR software, to read (or recognize) more than one type of font on a document.

polyline
)In computer graphics, a continuous line composed of one or more line segments. You can create a polyline by specifying the endpoints of each segment. In draw programs, you can treat a polyline as a single object, or divide it into its component segments.  

polymer
A chain of many monomers. For example, cellulose is a polymer that is formed from the monomer glucose.  Polymerization is a chemical reaction in which two or more molecules, or monomers, combine to form larger molecules, or polymers.

polymorphic_virus
A virus that changes its virus signature (i.e., its binary pattern) every time it replicates and infects a new file in order to keep from being detected by an antivirus program.

polymorphism
Generally, the ability to appear in many forms. In object-oriented programming, polymorphism refers to a programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class. More specifically, it is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes. For example, given a base class shape, polymorphism enables the programmer to define different area methods for any number of derived classes, such as circles, rectangles and triangles. No matter what shape an object is, applying the area method to it will return the correct results. Polymorphism is considered to be a requirement of any true object-oriented programming language (OOPL).

polyphonic_ringtone
In mobile phone technology, a polyphonic ringtone is a type of ringtone that is more advanced and offers better quality than standard monophonic ringtones. Polyphonic ringtones can consist of several notes at one time, compared to a  monophonic ringtone that consists of a series of notes, one musical note at a time.

PON
Short for Passive Optical Network, a high-bandwidth, point-to-multipoint optical fiber network based on the asynchronous transfer mode protocol (ATM), Ethernet or TDM.  PONs generally consist of an OLT (Optical Line Termination), which is connected to ONUs (Optical Network Units), aka subscriber terminals, using only fibre cables, optical splitters and other passive components (do not transmit signals using electricity). Up to 32 ONUs can be connected to an OLT.   The OLT is located at a local exchange, and the ONU is located either on the street, in a building, or even in a user's home.   PONs rely on lightwaves for data transfer.   In a PON, signals are routed over the local link with all signals along that link going to all interim transfer points. Optical splitters route signals through the network; optical receivers at intermediate points and subscriber terminals tuned for specific wavelengths of light direct signals intended for their groups of subscribers. At the final destination, a specific residence or business can detect its specified signal.   PONs are capable of delivering high volumes of upstream and downstream bandwidth (up to 622 Mbps downstream and 155 Mbps upstream), which can be changed "on-the-fly" depending on an individual user's needs.  

POP2
(1) POP is short for Post Office Protocol, a protocol used to retrieve e-mail from a mail server. Most e-mail applications (sometimes called an e-mail client) use the POP protocol, although some can use the newer IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol).
There are two versions of POP. The first, called POP2, became a standard in the mid-80's and requires SMTP to send messages. The newer version, POP3, can be used with or without SMTP.
(2) Pop is short for point of presence, an access point to the Internet. ISPs have typically multiple POPs. A point of presence is a physical location, either part of the facilities of a telecommunications provider that the ISP rents or a separate location from the telecommunications provider, that houses servers, routers, ATM switches and digital/analog call aggregators.

popunder
A type of window that appears behind the browser window of a Web site that a user has visited. In contrast to a pop-up ad, which appears over (on top of) the browser window, a pop-under is less obtrusive as it hides behind other windows. Pop-unders are used extensively in advertising on the Web, though advertising is not the only application for pop-under windows.  A pop-under is also referred to as a pop-under ad. See "How to Deal With Pop-Ups" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia.

popup
A type of window that appears on top of (over) the browser window of a Web site that a user has visited. In contrast to a pop-under ad, which appears behind (in back of) the browser window, a pop-up is more obtrusive as it covers other windows, particularly the window that the user is trying to read. Pop-ups ads are used extensively in advertising on the Web, though advertising is not the only application for pop-up windows.  A pop-up ad is also referred to as a pop-up. See "How to Deal With Pop-Ups" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. Also see pop-up window and pop-up utility.

popup_ad
A type of window that appears on top of (over) the browser window of a Web site that a user has visited. In contrast to a pop-under ad, which appears behind (in back of) the browser window, a pop-up is more obtrusive as it covers other windows, particularly the window that the user is trying to read. Pop-ups ads are used extensively in advertising on the Web, though advertising is not the only application for pop-up windows.  A pop-up ad is also referred to as a pop-up. See "How to Deal With Pop-Ups" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. Also see pop-up window and pop-up utility.

pop_up_blocker
A pop-up blocker refers to any  software or application that disables any pop-up, pop-over or pop-under advertisement window that you would see while using a Web browser. Some pop-up blockers may try to close all pop-up windows, some may remove all advertising from a publisher's Web site, and still others may help you choose which pop-up windows you want to be closed with block list feature.

pop_up_utility
A program installed to be memory resident so that you can always execute it by pressing a special key, called a hot key. When you press the hot key, the pop-up utility appears, regardless of which application you are currently running. When you exit the pop-up utility, the system returns you to your previous program.  In DOS systems, pop-up utilities are also called TSRs.   

pop_up_window
A window that suddenly appears (pops up) when you select an option with a mouse or press a special function key. Usually, the pop-up window contains a menu of commands and stays on the screen only until you select one of the commands. It then disappears.
A special kind of pop-up window is a pull-down menu, which appears just below the item you selected, as if you had pulled it down.
Also see pop-up ad.

port
(n.) (1) An interface on a computer to which you can connect a device. Personal computers have various types of ports. Internally, there are several ports for connecting disk drives, display screens, and keyboards. Externally, personal computers have ports for connecting modems, printers, mice, and other peripheral devices.
Almost all personal computers come with a serial RS-232C port or RS-422 port for connecting a modem or mouse and a parallel port for connecting a printer. On PCs, the parallel port is a Centronics interface that uses a 25-pin connector. SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) ports supporthigher transmission speeds than do conventional ports and enable you to attach up to seven devices to the same port.
 (2) In TCP/IP and UDP networks, an endpoint to a logical connection. The port number identifies what type of port it is. For example, port 80 is used for HTTP traffic. Also see Well-Known TCP Port Numbers in the Quick Referencesection of Webopedia.

port_forwarding
In home networking, port forwarding, also called port mapping or punch-through, enables you to create a permanent translation entry that maps a protocol port on your gateway machine to an IP address and protocol port on your private LAN. It's a transparent process, meaning network clients cannot see that port forwarding is being done. This process enables you to run a public Internet service on a machine that is otherwise hidden from the Internet by your gateway.  Port forwarding may also be used to aggregate traffic from an application that uses several ports for transactions and consolidate it into one port for reporting the total traffic identified with that application. Also see Well-Known TCP Port Numbers in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.

port_knocking
(p��rt nok´ing) (n.) A method of establishing a connection to a secured network or computer within a network that does not have an open port. A remote device sends a series of series of connection attempts, in the form of packets, to the computer��s closed ports, and the attempts are silently ignored but logged by the firewall. When the remote device has established the predetermined sequence of port connection attempts, a daemon triggers a port to open, and the network connection is established. This security method is analogous to knowing a "secret knock," and only people who know the proper knock sequence will be allowed access. An advantage of using a port knocking technique is that a malicious hacker cannot detect if a device is listening for port knocks.  Other forms: port knock (n.), (v.)

port_replicator
(pōrt rep´li-kāt-&r) (n.) A device containing common PC ports, such as serial and parallel ports, that plugs into a notebook computer. The purpose of the device is to allow you to easily attach a portable computer to standard, non-portable devices such as a printer and monitor. For example, if you use a computer both at home and at work, you could set up both work areas with a port replicator. Then, you just plug in your notebook computer to the port replicator at either location and you're ready to work.  Most notebook computer manufacturers offer a port replicator as an additional option. A port replicator is similar to a docking station, but docking stations provide additional slots for adding expansion boards and storage devices. 

port_scan
See port scanning. 

port_scanning
The act of systematically scanning a computer's ports. Since a port is a place where information goes into and out of a computer, port scanning identifies open doors to a computer. Port scanning has legitimate uses in managing networks, but port scanning also can be malicious in nature if someone is looking for a weakened access point to break into your computer.
Types of port scans:

vanilla: the scanner attempts to connect to all 65,535 ports
strobe: a more focused scan looking only for known services to exploit
fragmented packets: the scanner sends packet fragments that get through simple packet filters in a firewall
UDP: the scanner looks for open UDP ports
sweep: the scanner connects to the same port on more than one machine
FTP bounce: the scanner goes through an FTP serverin order to disguise the source of the scan
stealth scan: the scanner blocks the scanned computer from recording the port scan activities.

Port scanning in and of itself is not a crime. There is no way to stop someone from port scanning your computer while you are on the Internet because accessing an Internet server opens a port, which opens a door to your computer. There are, however, software products that can stop a port scanner from doing any damage to your system.

Port_to_Application_Mapping
Abbreviated as PAM, Port to Application Mapping is a feature of the Cisco IOS Firewall that allows you to customize TCP or UDP port numbers for network services or applications. Using the port information, PAM establishes a table of default port-to-application mapping information at the firewall. PAM also supports host or subnet specific port mapping, which allows you to apply PAM to a single host or subnet using standard access control lists (ACLs).

port_triggering
A type of port forwarding where outbound traffic on predetermined ports sends inbound traffic to specific incoming ports. Port triggering "triggers" an open incoming port when a client on the local network makes an outgoing connection to a predetermined port on a server. Port Triggering is more secure than port forwarding, because the incoming ports are not open all the time, they are open only when a program is actively using the trigger port. One major advantage of port triggering is that it allows computers behind a NAT-enabled router to provide services which would normally require a static host (one with an unchanging network address). The disadvantage of port forwarding is that it only allows one client on the network to use a particular service that occupies a particular port. 

portability
See portable.

portable
(adj.) (1) When used to describe hardware, portable means small and lightweight. A portable computer is a computer small enough to carry. Portable computers include notebook and subnotebook computers, hand-held computers, palmtops, and PDAs
.
(2) When used to describe software, portable means that the software has the ability to run on a variety of computers. Portable and machine independent mean the same thing-that the software does not depend on a particular type of hardware.

portable_image_storage_device
A small, portable storage device used for storing and viewing your digital images. The device is a portable hard drive in an enclosure that resembles handheld game consoles. The device usually offers USB and memory card readers as options for transferring your images directly to the device, as well as an LCD display for viewing the stored images. Depending on the manufacturer you may also have different controls for maneuvering through the images, such as forward, random, skip, and so on. One popular brand name of portable image storage devices is called the iAlbum. Also called on-the-go drive.

portable_mesh_repeater
A stand alone battery, charger and equipment pack used in field deployment situations for instant deployment to communications equipment. Portable mesh repeaters work as a router/repeater to extend mesh networks for connecting laptops, PDAs, video cameras and other portable devices to 802.11g or 802.11b networks. Also called a portable mesh repeater/router. See also repeater.

portal
(1) A Web portal or public portal refers to a Web site or service that offers a broad array of resources and services, such as e-mail, forums, search engines, and online shopping malls. The first Web portals were online services, such as AOL, that provided access to the Web, but by now most of the traditional search engines have transformed themselves into Web portals to attract and keep a larger audience.   (2) An enterprise portal is a Web-based interface for users of enterprise applications. Enterprise portals also provide access to enterprise information such as corporate databases, applications (including Web applications), and systems.


portal_application
A business application that is integrated to an enterprise portal and is used for business system data aggregation. See also Enterprise Portal Software.

portlet
A portlet is a Web-based component that will process requests and generate dynamic content. The end-user would essentially see a portlet as being a specialized content area within a Web page that occupies a small  window in the portal page. Depending on the content nature of the Web site providing the portlet you could use this area to receive different types of information such as travel information, business news, or even local weather. The portlet provides users with the capability to customize the content, appearance and position of the portlet. To create a portlet application, you should be a J2EE developer with a background in JavaServer Pages (JSP), JavaScript and HTML, and have a knowledge of Enterprise Java Beans.

portrait
)The terms portrait and landscape refer to different orientations of the paper -- whether it is oriented vertically or horizontally. A page with portrait orientation, typical for letters, memos, and other text documents, is taller than it is wide.  Not all printers are capable of generating text in landscape mode.  Orientation is also a characteristic of monitors. Portrait monitors are often called full-page monitors .   

POS
Point of sale, or POS as it is more commonly abbreviated, refers to the capturing of data and customer payment information at a physical location when goods or services are bought and sold. The POS transaction is captured using a variety of devices which include computers, cash registers, optical and bar code scanners, magnetic card readers, or any combination of these devices.

POSIX
Acronym for Portable Operating System Interface for UNIX, a set of IEEE and ISO standards that define an interface between programs and operating systems. By designing their programs to conform to POSIX, developers have some assurance that their software can be easily ported to POSIX-compliant operating systems. This includes most varieties of UNIX.  The POSIX standards are now maintained by an arm of the IEEE called the Portable Applications Standards Committee (PASC).  

post
(1) (v.) To publish a message in an online forum or newsgroup.  (n.) A message published in an online forum or newsgroup.  (2) Spelled POST, short for power-on self test. 

post_production
In digital video, photography, television and film, post-production refers to the tasks that must be completed or executed after the filming or shooting ends. This includes tasks such as the editing of raw footage to cut scenes, insert transition effects, working with voice and sound actors, and dubbing, to name a few of the many pre-production tasks. Post-production is the third and final step in film creation. It follows the pre-production and  production phases. See also pre-production and production.

postback
A mechanism introduced in the Microsoft ASP.NET to allow the communication between client side and server side.

PostgreSQL
Pronounced "post gress cue ell." PostgreSQL is an open source database system that began as an enhancement to the POSTGRES research prototype DBMS. Where POSTGRES used the PostQuel query language, PostgreSQL uses a subset of SQL.

PostScript
A page description language (PDL) developed by Adobe Systems. PostScript is primarily a language for printing documents on laser printers, but it can be adapted to produce images on other types of devices. PostScript is the standard for desktop publishing because it is supported by imagesetters, the very high-resolution printers used by service bureaus to produce camera-ready copy.  PostScript is an object-oriented language, meaning that it treats images, including fonts, as collections of geometrical objects rather than as bit maps. PostScript fonts are called outline fonts because the outline of each character is defined. They are also called scalable fonts because their size can be changed with PostScript commands. Given a single typeface definition, a PostScript printer can thus produce a multitude of fonts. In contrast, many non-PostScript printers represent fonts with bit maps. To print a bit-mapped typeface with different sizes, these printers require a complete set of bit maps for each size.  The principal advantage of object-oriented (vector) graphics over bit-mapped graphics is that object-oriented images take advantage of high-resolution output devices whereas bit-mapped images do not. A PostScript drawing looks much better when printed on a 600-dpi printer than on a 300-dpi printer. A bit-mapped image looks the same on both printers.  Every PostScript printer contains a built-in interpreter that executes PostScript instructions. If your laser printer does not come with PostScript support, you may be able to purchase a cartridge that contains PostScript.  There are three basic versions of PostScript: Level 1, Level 2 and PostScript 3. Level 2 PostScript, which was released in 1992, has better support for color printing. PostScript 3, release in 1997, supports more fonts, better graphics handling, and includes several features to speed up PostScript printing.   

potentiometer
An electronic component that is used to vary, or control, the amount of current that flows through an electronic circuit.  A potentiometer is also referred to as a pot.

POTS
Short for plain old telephone service, which refers to the standard telephone service that most homes use. In contrast, telephone services based on high-speed, digital communications lines, such as ISDN and FDDI, are not POTS. The main distinctions between POTS and non-POTS services are speed and bandwidth. POTS is generally restricted to about 52 Kbps (52,000 bitsper second).
The POTS network is also called the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
POTS should not be confused with pot, an abbreviation of potentiometer.

power_bi_for_office_365
Power BI for Office 365 is Microsoft's cloud-based business intelligence (BI) solution that works from within Excel and Office 365 to analyze and visualize data in a self-service way. The BI solution is designed to help business users gain insights from their data and, according to Microsoft, includes the following:


power_brick
(pow´&r brik) (n.) Also referred to as a transformer, an element of the external power supply for a notebook and/or laptop computer, used in conjunction with a battery pack. Since notebook computers rely on low-voltage DC, they need a way to convert the AC from a power source into DC that can be safely used by the computer. The power brick takes the AC voltage and converts it to a DC voltage slightly higher than the battery (the slight elevation in voltage ensures that the battery stays fully charged). Batteries normally supply the safe DC voltage to the portable computer, but power bricks are intended for use in conjunction with or instead of a mobile device��s battery.  Note Well: Unlike power supplies and voltage regulators for desktop computers, those for portable computers do not conform to any industry standards, so power bricks are not necessarily interchangeable among portable devices.

power_conditioner
Also called a line conditioner, a device that sits between a computer and its power supply, typically a wall outlet. The power conditioner provides protection against surges in power just as a surge protector does, but a power conditioner also maintains a continuous voltage fed to the computer during temporary voltage reductions, such as a brownout. This is referred to as conditioning. Power conditioners also can filter EMI emanating from a power source and can smooth the rhythmic cycle of alternating current.

power_cycling
(1) In the case of a frozen or hung device, power cycling refers to turning the device's power off and then on in order to get the device to function again. For example, if a desktop computer freezes, the user is unable to perform a routine shutdown by utilizing the shut down window. In order to get the device working again, the user must power cycle the device by manually by pressing the power key or disengaging the power source.  (2) With cable modems, power cycling is the process of unplugging the AC power adapter from the power source and plugging it back in.

power_down
To turn a machine off.  

power_factor_correction
Power factor correction (PFC) is a newer technology used in computer power supplies. PFC is applied to the circuits that include induction motors as a means of reducing the inductive component of the current and thereby reduce the losses in the supply. PFC has no effect on the operation of the motor itself. [Source: Adapted from LM Photonics Ltd]

power_line_Ethernet_bridge
A power line Ethernet bridge is a HomePlug device used to extend a LAN into a separate room using the existing electrical system in the building. An Ethernet cable from the network router is plugged into a bridge, which plugs into an AC wall outlet. In a separate room, a second bridge plugs into the wall outlet to provide an Ethernet port for the computer. Power line Ethernet bridges are a type of HomePlug device. See also HomePlug.

power_line_networking
Power line networking uses power line communications (PLC) to connect computers using existing power outlets in the home, essentially transforming every electrical outlet in the building into a network connection. Power line networking is one of the cheapest forms of home networking and has a low start-up cost and minimal IT workload. And despite using power outlets it also will not have an adverse effect on home electric bills. Power line networks can transmit phone calls and faxes as well as Internet services over regular electrical wiring.  See also power line communications (PLC).

power_management
Efficiently directing power to different components of a system. Power management is especially important for portable devices that rely on battery power. By reducing power to components that aren't being used, a good power management system can double or triple the lifetime of a battery. 

power_posting
In online forums power-posting is the term used to describe a user who posts a large number of empty or useless messages in order to increase their number of posts. On some forums special privileges may be given to users who contribute a specific number of posts. When power posting users will post meaningless replies such as "LOL" or "I agree/disagree." These posts may increase the users post count but they do not contribute anything meaningful to the forum discussion itself.

power_supply
(n.) Also called a power supply unit or PSU, the component that supplies power to a computer. Most personal computers can be plugged into standard electrical outlets. The power supply then pulls the required amount of electricity and converts the AC current to DC current. It also regulates the voltage to eliminate spikes and surges common in most electrical systems. Not all power supplies, however, do an adequate voltage-regulation job, so a computer is always susceptible to large voltage fluctuations.
Power supplies are rated in terms of the number of watts they generate. The more powerful the computer, the more watts it can provide to components.


power_up
To turn a machine on.  

Power_Usage_Effectiveness
In Green IT, Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is a calculation used to determine energy efficiency measurements. PUE is calculated by measuring the ratio of total energy consumption-the combination of servers plus the cooling to "useful" energy consumption (just servers). PUE is a green computing tool being promoted by The Green Grid as a way to measure the power delivered to IT equipment in its ratio with its total power consumption in the data center.
The Green Grid measures the following: PUE = Total Facility Power / IT Equipment Power (where Total Facility Power is the power measured at the utility meter. The IT Equipment Power is the actual load associated with all of the IT equipment including computing, storage and networking equipment).
 

power_user

The PowerMat technology and solutions have gained traction in the wireless charging market recently with companies like Starbucks, General Motors and AT&T having announced plans to adopt PowerMat products for use by their customers.

PowerPacket
PowerPacket technology uses the same power line that provides electricity to your computer to network it to other computers in your home or office. PowerPacket uses Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) to handle high-speed data transmission between computers. Electrical wires in a home are difficult to use for deploying a network as electrical wires are always in a state of flux. OFDM can detect changes within the power line and maintain network communication even during power fluctuations. PowerPacket is designed to seamlessly coexist with existing home networking technology, including HomePNA, 802.11b and HomeRF, and can also work with older home power line technologies. PowerPacket was developed by Intellon and is used as the baseline technology for the HomePlug specification.

PowerPC
A RISC -based computer  architecture developed jointly by IBM, Apple Computer, and Motorola Corporation. The name is derived from IBM's name for the architecture, Performance Optimization With Enhanced RISC.  The first computers based on the PowerPC architecture were the Power Macs, which appeared in 1994. Since then, other manufacturers, including IBM, have built PCs based on the PowerPC.  There are already a number of different operating systems that run on PowerPC-based computers, including the Macintosh operating system (System 7.5 and higher), Windows NT, and OS/2. 

PowerPoint_2010

New features in the latest releases of PowerPoint include direct video embedding and editing, Smart Guides, a new Reading View, a Broadcast Presentation feature, and new built-in transitions and animations effects.

PPC
Short for pay per click, PPC is an Internet marketing formula used to price online advertisements. In PPC programs the online advertisers will pay Internet Publishers the agreed upon PPC rate when an ad is clicked on, regardless if a sale is made or not.
With pay per click in search engine advertising, the advertiser would typically bid on a keyword so the PPC rate changes. On single website -- or network of content websites -- the site publisher would usually set  a fixed pay per click rate.  Also called cost-per-click (CPC).

PPCP
Short for PowerPC Platform, a computer hardware specification that allows a computer to run multiple operating systems. PPCP was developed jointly by Apple, IBM, and Motorola and was first called the Common Hardware Reference Platform (CHRP). The specification is based on the RISC architecture used for the RS/6000 mini-computer.  A computer that meets the PPCP standard allows you to select an application without regard to the underlying operating system. A PPCP computer can run any Mac, PC, or UNIX-based operating system without the usual modifications required to fit an operating system to a platform. 

PPGA
Short for Plastic Pin Grid Array. PPGAs were first developed by Intel in 1993 to combat power supply decoupling issues in high-performance microprocessors.This square chip packaging technology was designed for microprocessors with greater numbers of transistors on each chip than previous models. Unlike ceramic pin grid arrays (CPGA) or tape carrier packages (TCP), PPGA packages offer a greater amount of thermal resistance and improved electrical performance and power distribution, which directly affect the potential performance of microprocessors sensitive to heat transmission. 

ppi
Short for pixels per inch, a measurement of how a monitor displays an image. The resolution of an image displayed on a monitor is determined by its ppi, or the number of pixels contained within one square inch of monitor space.

PPM
PPM, short for project portfolio management, refers to a software package that enables corporate and business users to organize a series of projects into a single portfolio that will provide reports based on the various project objectives, costs, resources, risks and other pertinent associations. Project portfolio management software allows the user, usually management or executives within the company, to review the portfolio which will assist in making key financial and business decisions for the projects.

project_portfolio_management
PPM, short for project portfolio management, refers to a software package that enables corporate and business users to organize a series of projects into a single portfolio that will provide reports based on the various project objectives, costs, resources, risks and other pertinent associations. Project portfolio management software allows the user, usually management or executives within the company, to review the portfolio which will assist in making key financial and business decisions for the projects.

PPP
Short for Point-to-Point Protocol, a method of connecting a computer to the Internet. PPP is more stable than the older SLIP protocol and provides error checking features. Working in the data link layer of the OSI model, PPP sends the computer's TCP/IP packets to a server that puts them onto the Internet.   

PPPoA
Short for Point-to-Point Protocol over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).  PPPoA relies on two widely accepted standards: PPP and ATM. It is an  end-to-end asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) architecture. IP packets travel from the PC over Ethernet to the DSL modem, called the ADSL transceiver unit-remote (ATU-R). The ATU-R adds the PPP protocol to the IP packets and transports them to the carrier's Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiple (DSLAM) via ATM. It is a technology becoming more popular with DSL providers. See also Point-to-Point Protocol and PPPoE.

PPPoE
Acronym for Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet. PPPoE relies on two widely accepted standards: PPP and Ethernet. PPPoE is a specification for connecting the users on an Ethernet to the Internet through a common broadband medium, such as a single DSL line, wireless device or cable modem. All the users over the Ethernet share a common connection, so the Ethernet principles supporting multiple users in a LAN combine with the principles of PPP, which apply to serial connections.


PPTP
Short for Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol, a new technology for creating Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) , developed jointly by Microsoft Corporation, U.S. Robotics, and several remote access vendor companies, known collectively as the PPTP Forum. A VPN is a private network of computers that uses the public Internet to connect some nodes. Because the Internet is essentially an open network, the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is used to ensure that messages transmitted from one VPN node to another are secure. With PPTP, users can dial in to their corporate network via the Internet.


PQA
Short for Palm Query Application, a Web clipping application that allows Palm PDA users to interact wirelessly with Web content.

PRAM
Pronounced pee-ram, short for parameter RAM. On Macintosh computers, PRAM is a small portion of RAM used to store information about the way the system is configured. For example, parameter RAM holds the date and time, desktop pattern, mouse settings, volume settings, and other control data set with control panels. Parameter RAM is powered by a battery, so it does not lose its contents when the power is turned off. 

Pre_compilation_Tool

This includes tasks such as hiring actors or models, building sets, budgeting, planning, scheduling, renting equipment and tests, to name a few of the many pre-production tasks.

precedence
A characteristic of operators that indicates when they will be evaluated when they appear in complex expressions. Operators with high precedence are evaluated before operators with low precedence. For example, the multiplication operator (*) has higher preference than the addition operator (+), so the expression  2+3*4  equals 14, not 20.  You can override precedence rules by surrounding parts of an expression with parentheses. For example,  (2+3)*4  would evaluate to 20.   

precise_pangolin
Precise Pangolin is the Ubuntu codename for version 12.04 of the Ubuntu Linux-based operating system.  Officially released in April 2012, Precise Pangolin follows the Natty Narwhal (v11.04) release and serves as a major update for Ubuntu, with new cloud computing storage features via the Ubuntu One service as well as long term support (LTS), Metal-as-a-Service (MaaS) support and a number of other enterprise-focused additions and enhancements.  
Precise means "sharply defined or stated," and the pangolin is a scaly anteater indigenous to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. The Precise Pangolin release of Ubuntu was succeeded by Quantal Quetzal in October 2012.

precision
(pri-sizh´&n) (n.) (1) When used in reference to search engines, the ability of the search engine to return only relevant documents in the search results instead of documents that may not have relevance. Words in a search query that have more than one meaning have a greater chance of returning results that are not relevant as the search engine can only guess what information the user is searching for. Precision often is expressed as a percentage and is measured by dividing the number of relevant documents produced in a search by the total number of resultant documents that the search query presented. For example, if 100 pages are found in a search and 85 of those pages are relevant then the search had 85% precision.  Also see How Web Search Engines Work in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia.  (2) When used to describe floating-point numbers, the number of bits used to hold the fractional part. The more precision a system uses, the more exactly it can represent fractional quantities.  Floating-point numbers are often classified as single precision or double precision. A double-precision number uses twice as many bits as a single-precision value, so it can represent fractional quantities much more exactly. 

predictive_analysis
See data mining.

predictive_analytics
Predictive analytics is the practice of extracting information from existing data sets in order to determine patterns and predict future outcomes and trends.  Predictive analytics does not tell you what will happen in the future. It forecasts what might happen in the future with an acceptable level of reliability, and includes what-if scenarios and risk assessment.
Predictive Models and Analysis Applied to Business
Predictive models and analysis are typically used to forecast future probabilities. Applied to business, predictive models are used to analyze current data and historical facts in order to better understand customers, products and partners and to identify potential risks and opportunities for a company. It uses a number of techniques, including data mining, statistical modeling and machine learning to help analysts make future business forecasts.

The operator will see a display pop-up on their computer screen with information about the person they have called. Predictive dialers are widely used for customer support in call centers and telemarketing.

predictive_merchandising
Also called automated merchandising or personalized product recommendations, in electronic commerce it is a search technology that integrates data and predictive analytics to generate site merchandising. While exact features of predictive merchandising services differ from vendor to vendor, there all have some common functions. Usually tracking tags are used in a merchant's e-mail and on-site that capture and analyze key information at each point in the online shopping process. Web site visitor's preferences are tracked and the system is able to analyze that data in order to automate product offers to other customers with similar behavior on the site. Other aspects of automated merchandising include cross-sell and up-sell of related products, the capability for shoppers to compare related products, and the ability to show returning customers products they previously showed an interest in.  See also searchandizing.

premaster
The final version of a disc image which is sent to a replication facility for manufacturing.

premastering
The process used to create a master disc, also called a gold version, which is then duplicated for consumer distribution. Premastering usually refers to verifying the data and media on the disc, installing or loading the files to a hard drive or playing in a DVD player for film and video discs. This is the stage where any copy protection or encryption is included on the disc as well. It is a term used for both video and software mastering.

premium_content

presence
(1) The ability to detect the electronic presence of other users who are connected to the Internet, through a PC or mobile device, and whether they are available in real time. Presence services are commonly provided through applications like Finger, SMS, instant messaging clients, and discussion forums, although a number of companies are developing products in other areas that leverage presence, such as VoIP.   (2) The term Web presence refers to an individual or business having an established existence on the World Wide Web, through a Web site, e-mail, Internet advertising, blog, or a collection of Web files. Web presence is also called Internet presence.

presentation_graphics
A type of business software that enables users to create highly stylized images for slide shows and reports. The software includes functions for creating various types of charts and graphs and for inserting text in a variety of fonts. Most systems enable you to import data from a spreadsheet application to create the charts and graphs.  Presentation graphics is often called business graphics.  

Pretty_Good_Privacy
(n.) Abbreviated as PGP, a technique developed by Philip Zimmerman for encrypting messages. PGP is one of the most common ways to protect messages on the Internet because it is effective, easy to use, and free. PGP is based on the public-key method, which uses two keys -- one is a public key that you disseminate to anyone from whom you want to receive a message. The other is a private key that you use to decrypt messages that you receive.  To encrypt a message using PGP, you need the PGP encryption package, which is available for free from a number of sources. The official repository is at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  PGP is such an effective encryption tool that the U.S. government actually brought a lawsuit against Zimmerman for putting it in the public domain and hence making it available to enemies of the U.S. After a public outcry, the U.S. lawsuit was dropped, but it is still illegal to use PGP in many other countries.  

preview
)In word processing, previewing refers to formatting a document for the printer, but then displaying it on the display screen instead of printing it. Previewing allows you to see exactly how the document will appear when printed. If you have a WYSIWYG, previewing is unnecessary because the display screen always resembles the printed version. For word processors that are not WYSIWYGs, however, previewing is the next-best thing. If your word processor does not support previewing, you may be able to buy a separate program that allows you to preview documents.  

PRI
Short for Primary-Rate Interface, a type of ISDN service designed for larger organizations. PRI includes 23 B-channels (30 in Europe) and one D-Channel. In contrast, BRI (Basic-Rate Interface), which is designed for individuals and small businesses, contains just two B-channels and one D-channel.  PRI service is generally transmitted through a T-1 line (or an E1 line in Europe). 

primary_partition

printed_circuit_board
)Sometimes abbreviated PCB, a thin plate on which chips and other electronic components are placed. Computers consist of one or more boards, often called cards or adapters. Circuit boards fall into the following categories:

motherboard : The principal board that has connectors for attaching devices to the bus. Typically, the mother board contains the CPU, memory, and basic controllers for the system. On PCs, the motherboard is often called the system board or mainboard.
expansion board : Any board that plugs into one of the computer's expansion slots. Expansion boards include controller boards, LAN cards, and video adapters.
Daughtercard :Any board that attaches directly to another board.
controller board: A special type of expansion board that contains a controller for a peripheral device. When you attach new devices, such as a disk driveor graphics monitor, to a computer, you often need to add a controller board.
Network Interface Card (NIC) :An expansion board that enables a PC to be connected to a local-area network (LAN).
video adapter: An expansion board that contains a controller for a graphics monitor.

Printed circuit boards are also called cards.


printer
A printer is any device that prints text or illustrations on paper. There are many different types of printers. In terms of the technology utilized, printers fall into the following categories:

daisy-wheel: Similar to a ball-head typewriter, this type of printer has a plastic or metal wheel on which the shape of each character stands out in relief. A hammer presses the wheel against a ribbon, which in turn makes an ink stain in the shape of the character on the paper.Daisy-wheel printers produce letter-quality print but cannot print graphics.
dot-matrix: Creates characters by striking pins against an ink ribbon. Each pin makes a dot, and combinations of dots form characters and illustrations.
ink-jet: Sprays ink at a sheet of paper. Ink-jet printers produce high-quality text and graphics.
laser: Uses the same technology as copy machines. Laser printers produce very high quality text and graphics.
LCD  & LED  :Similar to a laser printer, but uses liquid crystals or light-emitting diodes rather than a laser to produce an image on the drum.
line printer: Contains a chain of characters or pins that print an entire line at one time. Line printers are very fast, but produce low-quality print.
thermal printer: An inexpensive printer that works by pushing heated pins against heat-sensitive paper. Thermal printers are widely used in calculators and fax machines.

Printer Characteristics
Printers are also classified by the following characteristics:

quality of type: The output produced by printers is said to be either letter quality (as good as a typewriter), near letter quality, or draft quality. Only daisy-wheel, ink-jet, and laser printers produce letter-quality type. Some dot-matrix printers claim letter-quality print, but if you look closely, you can see the difference.
speed: Measured in characters per second (cps) or pages per minute(ppm), the speed of printers varies widely. Daisy-wheel printers tend to be the slowest, printing about 30 cps. Line printers are fastest (up to 3,000 lines per minute). Dot-matrix printers can print up to 500 cps, and laser printers range from about 4 to 20 text pages per minute.
impact or non-impact: Impact printers include all printers that work by striking an ink ribbon. Daisy-wheel, dot-matrix, and line printers are impact printers. Non-impact printers include laser printers and ink-jet printers. The important difference between impact and non-impact printers is that impact printers are much noisier.
graphics:Some printers (daisy-wheel and line printers) can print only text. Other printers can print both text and graphics.
fonts : Some printers, notably dot-matrix printers, are limited to one or a few fonts. In contrast, laser and ink-jet printers are capable of printing an almost unlimited variety of fonts. Daisy-wheel printers can also print different fonts, but you need to change the daisy wheel, making it difficult to mix fonts in the same document.


printer_driver
A program that controls a printer. Whenever you print a document, the printer driver takes over, feeding data to the printer with the correct control commands. Most modern operating systems come with printer driversfor the most common types of printers, but you must install them before you can use the printer. You can also download updated drivers from the printer manufacturer's Web site.

printer_engine
The main component of a printer that actually performs the printing. The printer engine determines how fast and at what resolution the printer can print. Although there are many manufacturers of printers, many use the same printer engines. The difference between printers using the same printer engine revolves around other features, such as paper handling abilities and the console.  

printout
A printed version of text or data. Another term for printout is hard copy.   

Prism
Acronym for Publishers Requirements for Industry Standard Metadata, a standard for metadata oriented toward magazine publishers that contains a lightweight rights description language, governed by IDEAlliance.Prism can also refer to the PRISM Program, a massive surveillance program operated by the United States National Security Agency (NSA).

prism_program
PRISM program is a massive surveillance program operated by the United States National Security Agency (NSA). The PRISM program utilizes extensive data mining efforts to collect information and analyze that data for patterns of terrorist or other potential criminal activity.
PRISM: Clouded in Secrecy
PRISM has been clouded in secrecy since its creation in 2007, but it gained widespread attention recently as a result of its suspected use of data obtained from the servers of major internet companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, AOL, Skype and YouTube. This data is believed to include e-mails, documents, photographs, chats (audio and video) and connection logs of users.


privacy_statement
A Web document found on a company or organization's Web site that details the type of personally identifiable information the company collects about its site visitors, how the information is used  including who it may be shared with  and how users can control the information that is gathered.

private_cloud
Private cloud is the phrase used to describe a cloud computing platform that is implemented within the corporate firewall, under the control of the IT department.
A private cloud is designed to offer the same features and benefits of public cloud systems, but removes a number of objections to the cloud computing model including control over enterprise and customer data, worries about security, and issues connected to regulatory compliance.
Private Cloud Security
A private cloud implementation aims to avoid many of the objections regarding cloud computing security. Because a private cloud setup is implemented safely within the corporate firewall, a private cloud provides more control over the company's data, and it ensures security, albeit with greater potential risk for data loss due to natural disaster.

private_cloud_project
Companies initiate private cloud projects to enable their IT infrastructure to become more capable of quickly adapting to continually evolving business needs and requirements. Private cloud projects can also be connected to public clouds to create hybrid clouds.  Unlike a public cloud, a private cloud project remains within the corporate firewall and under the control on the company’s IT department. As a result, a private cloud provides more control over the company’s data, and it ensures security -- albeit with greater potential risk for data loss due to natural disaster.
Launching a private cloud project involves analyzing the need for a private cloud, formulating a plan for how to create a private cloud, developing cloud policies for access and security, deploying and testing the private cloud infrastructure, and training employees and partners on the cloud computing project.
Private Cloud Project Strategy
To create a private cloud project strategy, a company will first need to identify which of its business practices can be made more efficient than before, as well as which repetitive manual tasks can be automated via the successful launch of a cloud computing project.  By creating a private cloud strategy, the resulting cloud will be able to deliver automatic, scalable server virtualization, providing the benefits of automated provision of resources and the optimal use of hardware within the IT infrastructure.

private_cloud_storage
A form of cloud storage where the enterprise data and cloud storage resources both reside within the enterprise's data center and behind the firewall.  Also known as internal storage clouds, private cloud storage services are managed inside the data center and as a result almost always carry higher capital and maintenance costs than public cloud storage services due to the enterprise needing to provide the data center space, network connectivity, power and cooling.
Private cloud storage does help resolve the potential for security and performance concerns while still offering many of the benefits of cloud storage such as scalability, reliability, rapid deployment and the option of management by a specialized cloud storage provider.

probe_message
In e-mail, a probe message is a type of bounce handling for e-mail address verification. It is commonly used in subscription-based mailing lists that easily become filled with invalid subscriber addresses. Once an e-mail has bounced from a specific address, a system will wait a specific amount of time then sends a warning message to the user. If the warning message bounces a probe message is then sent. If this also bounces the subscriber is then removed from the mailing list. Also see Why E-Mails Bounce in the Did You Know section of Webopedia.

In digital video, photography, television and film, production refers to the tasks that must be completed or executed during the filming or shooting. This includes tasks such as setting up scenes, the capture of raw footage, and usage of set designs, to name a few of the many pre-production tasks. Production is the second step in film creation. It follows the pre-production phase and evolves into the post-production stage. See also pre-production and post production.

production_grade
In computer and technology terminology, "production grade" is a phrase that is used to describe more robust and rugged hardware and software that is designed for intensive business and enterprise computing environments. This is in contrast to consumer grade equipment, which would be used less frequently and for less intensive tasks.

Professional_Services_Automation
Professional Services Automation (PSA) refers to a suite of software enabling IT service organizations to manage people and skilled resources.

program
(n) An organized list of instructions that, when executed, causes the computerto behave in a predetermined manner. Without programs, computers are useless.
A program is like a recipe. It contains a list of ingredients (called variables) and a list of directions (called statements) that tell the computer what to do with the variables. The variables can represent numeric data, text, or graphical images.
There are many programming languages -- C, C++, Pascal, BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL, and LISP are just a few. These are all high-level languages. One can also write programs in low-level languages called assembly languages, although this is more difficult. Low-level languages are closer to the languageused by a computer, while high-level languages are closer to human languages.

program_stream
Abbreviated as PS or MPEG-PS, program stream is a container format for storage applications specified in MPEG-1 Systems and MPEG-2 Part 1. A program stream contains only one content channel and is suited to authoring and storage not broadcasting. Contrast with transport stream, which is designed to address the delivery of the content.

Programmable_Interrupt_Controller
Abbreviated as PIC, a Programmable Interrupt Controller is a interrupt controller that manages interrupt signals received from devices by combining multiple interrupts into a single interrupt output. PIC is found on most PCs today. One of the most well-known Programmable Interrupt Controllers is Intel 8259A, which was included in the x86 PC as a part of the motherboard chipset.  Compare with Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC).

programmer
(1) An individual who writes programs.
(2) A device that writes a program onto a PROM chip.
 

programming_language

A vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer to perform specific tasks. The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal. Each language has a unique set of keywords (words that it understands) and a special syntax for organizing program instructions.
High-level programming languages, while simple compared to human languages, are more complex than the languages the computer actually understands, called machine languages. Each different type of CPUhas its own unique machine language.

Progress
A leading software company in the DBMS field. Although Progress Software has its own DBMS system, it's real strength is in providing tools to develop applications that can interact with any DBMS. 

progressive_scan
Progressive scan (also known as known as 480p) is one of two methods used for "painting" an image on a television screen (the other being interlaced scan), where the lines are drawn in one at a time in sequential order. The entire single frame image is painted every 1/60th of a second, allowing for twice the detail to be sent in the same amount of time used in interlaced systems. Progressive scan is a method used in today's CRTs, computer monitors and high-end television displays. Progressive scanning results in a more detailed image on the screen and is also less susceptible to the flicker commonly associated with interlaced scanning.  Most television displays that are capable of progressive scanning can also perform deinterlacing, which enables interlaced video to be viewed on progressive scan sets. Progressive scan is now the standard of choice for both DVD video and DTV. To use and view progressive scanning technology the source (DVD player, High-definition cable or satellite for example) and the display must both be progressive scan compatible. Compare with interlaced scan.

project_administrator
The IT project administrator contributes essential administrative support to coordinate a technical team, typically under the direction of a project manager or leader. Duties of a project administrator include all aspects of facilitating a project: scheduling meeting times and locations, taking meeting minutes, developing presentations, and arranging training for project staff. In addition, the project administrator participates in budget administration, providing analysis, keeping records, and forecasting financial performance. IT project administrators may work closely with other corporate departments, such as HR and legal.
IT project administration brings together business administration and technical knowledge. A bachelor's degree in business or management information systems offers the best foundation for a project administrator career. It's also possible to start a career with a two-year information technology degree and some business experience. With additional training such as a Project Management Professional (PMP) certification or an MBA in information systems, administrators can advance into a project manager role.

project_analyst
The project analyst provides critical data support to a technical team. Research and analysis functions may include budget tracking and financial forecasting, project evaluation and monitoring, maintaining compliance with corporate and public regulations, and performing any data analysis relevant to project tasks. Project analysts define key performance parameters and create regular variance reports to track progress.
A bachelor's degree in computer science, management information systems, or business administration is the standard qualification for an analyst position. A combination of an associate-level computer science degree and several years' experience may also offer entry into project analysis. To progress into a project manager or leader role, certification as a Project Management Professional (PMP) often helps.
See also the list of Computer Certifications in Webopedia's Quick Reference section.

project_control_officer
The project control officer bears responsibility for defining clear roles and accountability measures on an IT team. Working under the direction of senior project managers, this mid-level manager oversees the project's list of action items and briefs the team on weekly or monthly progress. The project control officer may also monitor budget and risk management priorities to ensure that the project stays on track financially. Project control officers typically provide the link between project managers and technical specialists, so a working knowledge of both business administration and information technology is essential.
A computer science or information technology degree is the typical starting point for a project control officer career. A bachelor's degree offers a solid foundation, with a comprehensive curriculum combining core communication and analytical skills with computer training. Control officers can advance into project management with an MBA or Project Management Professional (PMP) certification.
See also the list of Computer Certifications in Webopedia's Quick Reference section.

project_director
The project director of an information technology team is responsible for managing a project at the strategic level. The project director is typically the project's point person, managing resources and overseeing finances to ensure that the project progresses on time and on budget. The director reviews regular progress reports and makes staffing, financial, or other adjustments to align the developing project with broader outcome goals. A project director generally oversees a team of project managers and project teams.
A bachelor's degree in computer science, information technology management, or management information systems is the standard minimum degree for a senior project management career. Project directors often advance into the role from a project manager position, armed with an MBA degree in information technology and/or a Project Management Professional (PMP) certification. Those who advance into this senior project management position can earn six figures and enjoy a leadership position.

project-spartan
Project Spartan is the codename for a Web browser introduced in Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system that the company created to eventually supplant the venerable Internet Explorer Web browser.
Microsoft developed the Project Spartan browser to be more streamlined and faster than IE as well as to be compatible across a wide variety of computers and devices and built specifically for the more modernized Web.
Some of Project Spartan's features include built-in support for Cortana, Microsoft's voice-activated intelligent assistant technology; capabilities for "inking" (writing or typing directly on a Web page) via integration with Microsoft OneNote and then sharing these notes or comments with others via e-mail or a social network; and Reading Lists and Reading Views for a more organized, efficiently managed approach to Web browsing.

projectlibre
ProjectLibre is an open source project management software solution developed as an alternative to Microsoft Project. As with other project management tools, ProjectLibre maintains a list of tasks for users and automatically organizes and tracks tasks and projects as progress is made or they’re completed.
ProjectLibre is designed to complement the LibreOffice and OpenOffice open source office suites, providing project managers and team leaders with a complete collection of productivity tools. In addition to the standard ProjectLibre software, cloud and server versions of ProjectLibre are in development and are expected to become available in 2014.

Prolog
Short for Programming Logic, Prolog is a high-level programming language based on formal logic. Unlike traditional programming languages that are based on performing sequences of commands, Prolog is based on defining and then solving logical formulas. Prolog is sometimes called a declarative language or a rule-based language because its programs consist of a list of facts and rules. Prolog is used widely for artificial intelligence applications, particularly expert systems. 

PROM
Short for programmable read-only memory, a memory chip on which data can be written only once. Once a program has been written onto a PROM, it remains there forever. Unlike RAM, PROMs retain their contents when the computer is turned off.
The difference between a PROM and a ROM (read-only memory) is that a PROM is manufactured as blank memory, whereas a ROM is programmed during the manufacturing process. To write data onto a PROM chip, you need a special device called a PROM programmer  or PROM burner. The process of programming a PROM is sometimes called burningthe PROM.
An EPROM (erasable programmable read-only memory) is a special type of PROM that can be erased by exposing it to ultraviolet light. Once it is erased, it can be reprogrammed. An EEPROM is similar to a PROM, but requires only electricity to be erased.

prompt
A symbol on a display screen indicating that the computer is waiting for input. Once the computer has displayed a prompt, it waits for you to enter some information. Generally, it will wait forever, but some programs have built-in time-outs that cause the program to continue execution after it has waited a specified amount of time.   

proof_of_concept_code
A term used to describe code that has been developed to demonstrate possible vulnerabilities in software and operating systems, and to show the security risks of a particular method of attack.

proof_of_concept_virus
A proof of concept virus is written by an individual with advanced programming skills, usually to 'show off' their programming talents or to point out a vulnerability in a specific software. Usually authors of proof-of-concept viruses will send these programs to an anti-virus software developer, and the programmer would be more apt to produce a blueprint on how the virus would work, rather than launching the virus maliciously.

property
Characteristic of an object. In many programming languages, including Visual Basic, the term property>/I> is used to describe attributes associated with a data structure.  

proportional_font
)A font in which different characters have different pitches (widths). Proportional fonts are also called proportional-pitch fonts. The opposite of a proportional font is a fixed-pitch font.   

proportional_spacing
)Using different widths for different characters. In a proportionally spaced font, the letter I is narrower than the letter q and the letter m wider. This book uses a proportionally spaced font, as do most books, magazines, and newspapers.  The opposite of proportional spacing is monospacing. In a monospaced font, each character has the same width. Non-graphics  display screens, display text in a monospaced font. Almost all printers, with the exception of line printers, are able to print with either proportionally spaced or monospaced fonts.   

proprietary
Privately owned and controlled. In the computer industry, proprietary is the opposite of open. A proprietary design or technique is one that is owned by a company. It also implies that the company has not divulged specifications that would allow other companies to duplicate the product.
Increasingly, proprietary architectures are seen as a disadvantage. Consumers prefer open and standardized architectures, which allow them to mix and match products from different manufacturers.


proprietary_software
Refers to any computer software that has restrictions on any combination of the usage, modification, copying or distributing modified versions of the software. Proprietary software usually can be distributed at no cost or for a fee. Proprietary software may also be called closed-source software. See "Is Software Ownership the Same as Licensing?" in the in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia. Also see "All About Software: Categories of applications software explained" in the "Did You Know..." section of Webopedia.

protected_mode
A type of memory utilization available on Intel 80286 and later model microprocessors. In protected mode, these processors provide the following features:

protection: Each programcan be allocated a certain section of memory. Other programs cannot use this memory, so each program is protected from interference from other programs.
extended memory : Enables a single program to accessmore than 640K of memory.
virtual memory : Expands the address spaceto over 1GB.
multitasking : Enables the microprocessor to switch from one program to another so the computer can execute several programs at once.

Although the DOS operating system is not designed to take advantage of these features, some DOS programs can run in protected mode using special drivers. More sophisticated operating system, such as OS/2, Windows, or UNIX, have built-in support for protected mode.

protocol
An agreed-upon format for transmitting data between two devices. The protocol determines the following:

the type of error checking to be used


data compression method, if any


how the sending device will indicate that it has finished sending a message


how the receiving device will indicate that it has received a message

There are a variety of standard protocols from which programmerscan choose. Each has particular advantages and disadvantages; for example, some are simpler than others, some are more reliable, and some are faster.
From a user's point of view, the only interesting aspect about protocols is that your computer or device must support the right ones if you want to communicate with other computers. The protocol can be implemented either in hardware or in software.

protocol_stack
A set of network protocol layers that work together. The OSI Reference Model that defines seven protocol layers is often called a stack, as is the set of TCP/IP protocols that define communication over the internet.  The term stack also refers to the actual software that processes the protocols. So, for example, programmers sometimes talk about loading a stack, which means to load the software required to use a specific set of protocols. Another common phrase is binding a stack, which refers to linking a set of network protocols to a network interface card (NIC). Every NIC must have at least one stack bound to it.  In Windows, the TCP/IP stack is implemented by the Winsock DLL. 

Protocol_Independent_Multicast
Abbreviated PIM, a multicasting routing protocol that runs over an existing unicast infrastructure. There are two variations of PIM: PIM-SM -- Short for PIM-Sparse Mode, which is used when recipients are scattered over a large area. PIM-DM -- Short for PIM-Dense Mode, which is used when the targeted recipients are in a concentrated area. 

prototype
1) An original type, form, or instance serving as a basis or standard for later stages. 2) An original, full-scale, and usually working model of a new product or new version of an existing product. 3) An early, typical example.

provisioning
(n.) (1) The process of providing users with access to data and technology resources. The term typically is used in reference to enterprise-level resource management. Provisioning can be thought of as a combination of the duties of the human resources and IT departments in an enterprise, where (1) users are given access to data repositories or granted authorization to systems, applications and databases based on a unique user identity, and (2) users are appropriated hardware resources, such as computers, mobile phones and pagers. The process implies that the access rights and privileges are monitored and tracked to ensure the security of an enterprise's resources.
(2) The process of providing customers or clients with accounts, the appropriate access to those accounts, all the rights associated with those accounts, and all of the resources necessary to manage the accounts. When used in reference to a client, provisioning can be thought of as a form of customer service.

proximity_operator
A type of operator used by some search engines to improve search constraints by instructing the search to look for words that are within a short distance of each other in a document. For example, using a search engine that supports proximity operators, querying the phrase "cable NEAR modem" will instruct the search engine to look in documents for instances of the words "cable" and "modem" that are near each other. Different search engines will specify different distances that the words must be within.

proxy_cache
(pro´ksē cash) (n.) Also referred to as a Web proxy cache, a function of a proxy server that caches retrieved Web pages on the server's hard disk so that the page can be quickly retrieved by the same or a different user the next time that page is requested. The proxy cache eases bandwidth requirements and reduces delays that are inherent in a heavily trafficked, Internet-connected network. Because the page is stored locally on the proxy server, the page is delivered to the next request at local network speeds. The proxy cache also is advantageous when browsing multiple pages of the same Web site. The proxy cache also stores all of the images and sub-files for the visited pages, so if the user jumps to a new page within the same site that uses, for example, the same images, the proxy cache has them already stored and can load them into the user's browser quicker than having to retrieve them from the Web site server's remote site.

proxy_server
A proxy server is a server that sits between a client application, such as a Web browser, and a real server. It intercepts all requests to the real server to see if it can fulfill the requests itself. If not, it forwards the request to the real server.
Purpose of a Proxy Server
Proxy servers have two main purposes: to improve performance and to filter requests.
Improve Performance
Proxy servers can dramatically improve performance for groups of users. This is because it saves the results of all requests for a certain amount of time. Consider the case where both user X and user Y access the World Wide Web through a proxy server. First user X requests a certain Web page, which we'll call Page 1. Sometime later, user Y requests the same page. Instead of forwarding the request to the Web server where Page 1 resides, which can be a time-consuming operation, the proxy server simply returns the Page 1 that it already fetched for user X. Since the proxy server is often on the same network as the user, this is a much faster operation. Real proxy servers support hundreds or thousands of users. 

Proxy_Trojan
A type of Trojan horse designed to use the victim's computer as a  proxy server. This gives the attacker the opportunity to do everything from your computer, including the possibility of conducting credit card fraud and other illegal activities, or even to use your system to launch malicious attacks against other networks. See also  Trojan horse.

PRW
Abbreviation for "parents are watching". PRW is commonly used in newsgroups, chat rooms, instant messaging,  text messaging, SMS, e-mail and other real time text-based communications. See also "Text Messaging Abbreviations" in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia for definitions to hundreds of frequently used chat abbreviations.

PS_2_port
A type of port developed by IBM for connecting a mouse or keyboard to a PC. The PS/2 port supports a mini DIN plug containing just 6 pins. Most PCs have a PS/2 port so that the serial port can be used by another device, such as a modem. The PS/2 port is often called the mouse port. 

PSA
Professional Services Automation (PSA) refers to a suite of software enabling IT service organizations to manage people and skilled resources.

PSAP
Short for public safety answering point, a physical location where 911 emergency telephone calls are received and then routed to the proper emergency services. See E911.

PSDN
Short for packet-switched data network, a data communications network that is based on the principles of packet switching, as opposed to circuit switching that is used in public telephone networks. Packet-switched networks do not establish physical communication channels between communicating devices like circuit-switched networks do. Instead, signals are formed into fixed-length packets that are affixed with a source and destination address and packet ordering details. The packets then rely on network routers to read the address data and route the packets through the network to their destinations. When the packets arrive at the receiving device, the packet ordering data is used to reassemble the original signal. One advantage of packet-switched networks is that packets from different sources going to different destinations can share common data pathways.  Also called a packet-switched network, or PSN.

pseudocode
An outline of a program, written in a form that can easily be converted into real programming statements. For example, the pseudocode for a bubble sortroutine might be written:
while not at end of list compare adjacent elements if second is greater than first switch them  get next two elements if elements were switchedrepeat for entire list
Pseudocode cannot be compiled nor executed, and there are no real formatting or syntax rules. It is simply one step - an important one - in producing the final code. The benefit of pseudocode is that it enables the programmer to concentrate on the algorithms without worrying about all the syntactic details of a particular programming language. In fact, you can write pseudocode without even knowing what programming language you will use for the final implementation.

PSIP
(pronounced P-SIP) Acronym for Program and Systems Information Protocol, is the ATSC standard for digital television channel naming, numbering and navigation.

PSK
Short for phase-shift keying, a modulation technique used by modems in which different phase angles in the carrier signal are used to represent the binary states of 0 and 1.  The simplest method of PSK, also called biphase modulation, uses two signal phases - 0 degrees and 180 degrees. The digital signal is broken up according to time into binary digits and the state (1 or 0) of each bit is determined according the state of the bit that preceded it. If the phase of the bit does not change then the state of the signals stays the same. If the phase of the signal changes by 180 degrees, then the signal state changes (from 0 to 1, or 1 to 0).  There are more complex forms of PSK that rely on four or eight phases to transmit data at a faster rate.  Compare with FSK.

PSN
Short for packet-switched data network, a data communications network that is based on the principles of packet switching, as opposed to circuit switching that is used in public telephone networks. Packet-switched networks do not establish physical communication channels between communicating devices like circuit-switched networks do. Instead, signals are formed into fixed-length packets that are affixed with a source and destination address and packet ordering details. The packets then rely on network routers to read the address data and route the packets through the network to their destinations. When the packets arrive at the receiving device, the packet ordering data is used to reassemble the original signal. One advantage of packet-switched networks is that packets from different sources going to different destinations can share common data pathways.  Also called a packet-switched network, or PSN.

PSOP
Short for Plastic Small Outline Package, it's a surface-mount memory packaging from Intel. key features of the PSOP include the following: JEDEC standard compliance, footprint and height 50 percent of DIP, two-side leaded for routing simplicity, 50 mil (1.27 mm) pitch for SMT simplicity and ease of use, gull wing formed leads, and it supports future flash density and feature growth. Intel's PSOP is JEDEC standard. See also Small Outline Package.

PSTN
Short for Public Switched Telephone Network, which refers to the international telephone system based on copper wires carrying analog voice data. This is in contrast to newer telephone networks base on digital technologies, such as ISDN and FDDI.
Telephone service carried by the PSTN is often called plain old telephone service (POTS).


PSU
(n.) Also called a power supply unit or PSU, the component that supplies power to a computer. Most personal computers can be plugged into standard electrical outlets. The power supply then pulls the required amount of electricity and converts the AC current to DC current. It also regulates the voltage to eliminate spikes and surges common in most electrical systems. Not all power supplies, however, do an adequate voltage-regulation job, so a computer is always susceptible to large voltage fluctuations.
Power supplies are rated in terms of the number of watts they generate. The more powerful the computer, the more watts it can provide to components.


PTAL
Short for Payment Transaction Application Layer, an open standard developed in part by CommerceNet that allows merchants to accept any type of electronic payment over the Internet.

PTR
Short for personal video recorder, PVR is a generic term for a device that is similar to a VCR but records television data in digital format as opposed to the VCR's analog format. VCRs utilize analog tapes to record and play programs broadcast over television, but PVRs encode video data in MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 formats and store the data in a hard drive. PVRs have all of the same functionality of VCRs (recording, playback, fast forwarding, rewinding, pausing) plus the ability to instantly jump to any part of the program without having to rewind or fast forward the data stream.
A PVR is essentially made up of two elements: the device that stores its hardware elements, such as the hard disk drive, power supply and buses, and the software in the form of a subscription service that provides programming information and the ability to encode the data streams.
Two common PVR systems are TiVo and ReplayTV.

PTSW
Short for Ping the Semantic Web, PTSW is a repository for RDF documents and tracks the creation and modification of RDF based data sources for the Semantic Web.

PTT
Push-to-talk (or press-to-talk) is a two-way communication method that uses half-duplex mode where transmission occurs in both directions, but not at the same time. To use PTT, users must press a button on the PTT device while speaking, then release it when done. The listener must then do the same to respond. Common PTT devices include the walkie-talkie. Newer PTT systems use VoIP to provide digital PTT service over 3G data networks. Synonymous with press-to-talk. 
In PC and mobile voice chat applications, push-to-talk is a software feature that requires the speaker to press a button to enable voice speaking. This prevents background noises and talking from sending during the chat session.
Push-to-talk may be abbreviated as PTT or P2T.See also Push-to-talk Over Cellular.

PTT_Menu
Short for Part of The Title Menu. Same as chapter menu.

PTT_open_group
PTT service term. Subscribers can create what is commonly called a public or open group, which can be made available for any PTT user to join.

public_carrier
A government-regulated organization that provides telecommunications services to the public. This includes AT&T, MCI, and Western Union. Most public carriers provide electronic- mail services that enable you to send messages and documents over a telephone line to other computer  users. 

public_cloud
A form of cloud computing in which a company relies on a third-party cloud service provider for services such as servers, data storage and applications, which are delivered to the company through the Internet. A public cloud can free companies from the potentially expensive costs of having to purchase, manage and maintain on-premises hardware and software infrastructure.
Public clouds can also typically be deployed much faster and with more scalability and accessibility than on-premises infrastructure as a result of the public cloud provider’s expertise and existing infrastructure. Public cloud subscribers may pay pay-as-you-go fees or fixed monthly fees for the public cloud services they utilize.
Related Terms: Public cloud storage, hybrid cloud, private cloud and private cloud project

public_cloud_storage
A form of cloud storage where the enterprise and storage service provider are separate and the data is stored outside of the enterprise's data center. With public cloud storage, or external storage clouds, enterprises and small businesses offload their data storage and archival / backup needs to a third-party cloud storage service provider, freeing them from the expensive costs of having to purchase, manage and maintain on-premises storage hardware and software resources.
In most cases, public cloud storage can also be deployed much faster and with more scalability and accessibility than on-premises data storage. In addition to storing static data, public cloud storage services can often store live data generated by applications running on a company's on-premises resources.  See also Webopedia’s Cloud Computing Dictionary Resource and Cloud Computing Security Challenges.

Public_PAD
Provided by the Post Telephone and Telegraph (PTT) administration or network provider that you can access by a local call on the public switched network. Once your terminal is connected to the public PAD, you enter the NUA of your host DTE and the PAD establishes the communications. [Source:  IBM Information center] See also PAD.

public_domain_software
Refers to any program that is not copyrighted. Public-domain software is free and can be used without restrictions. The term public-domain software is often used incorrectly to include freeware, free software that is nevertheless copyrighted.   

public_key_cryptography
A cryptographic system that uses two keys -- a public key known to everyone and a private or secret key known only to the recipient of the message. When John wants to send a secure message to Jane, he uses Jane's public key to encrypt the message. Jane then uses her private key to decryptit.
An important element to the public key system is that the public and private keys are related in such a way that only the public key can be used to encrypt messages and only the corresponding private key can be used to decrypt them. Moreover, it is virtually impossible to deduce the private key if you know the public key.
Public-key systems, such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), are becoming popular for transmitting information via the Internet. They are extremely secure and relatively simple to use. The only difficulty with public-key systems is that you need to know the recipient's public key to encrypt a message for him or her. What's needed, therefore, is a global registry of public keys, which is one of the promises of the new LDAPtechnology.

puck
A pointing device used with digitizing tablets. See under digitizing tablet. 

pull
To request data from another program or computer. The opposite of pull is push, where data is sent without a request being made. The terms push and pull are used frequently to describe data sent over the Internet. The World Wide Web is based on pull technologies, where a page isn't delivered until a browser requests it. Increasingly, however, Information services are harnessing the Internet to broadcast information using push technologies. A prime example is the PointCast Network. 

pull_printing
Also called Driverless Printing Pull printing is a printer feature intended for large and busy organizations that print long,  or color-rich documents. A print job is sent to a pull printing server, which delivers the print job to the printer. This frees up your computer for other tasks and reduces network traffic. Word processing documents and even Web pages (referred to as Web pull printing) can be pull printed without having the file opened on your computer. You send the documents location to the pull printing server for processing.

pull_strategy
A channel partner term that is used to describe how products and services move through channel partners to the consumer. A pull strategy is where interest for a specific product or service is created within a target audience that then demands the product from channel partners. This causes the product to be "pulled" through the manufacturer's sales channel. Pull strategy is one of several types of channel strategies.
Contrast with push strategy.

pull_down_menu
(n.) Also called a drop-down menu, a menu of commands or options that appears when you select an item with a mouse. The item you select is generally at the top of the display screen, and the menu appears just below it, as if you had pulled it down. 

pulling_wire
A phrase used to describe the act of running network cable from one location to another.

pulse_amplitude_modulation
A form of signal modulation in which the data is encoded in the amplitude of a series, or train, of regularly recurrent signal pulses. PAM is used less frequently than PCM.

pulse_code_modulation
Short for pulse code modulation, a sampling technique for digitizing analog signals, especially audio signals. PCM samples the signal 8000 times a second; each sample is represented by 8 bits for a total of 64 Kbps. There are two standards for coding the sample level. The Mu-Law standard is used in North America and Japan while the A-Law standard is use in most other countries.  PCM is used with T-1 and T-3 carrier systems. These carrier systems combine the PCM signals from many lines and transmit them over a single cable or other medium. PCM is also the usual digital method used for music audio playback of music CDs. While supported by DVDs, DVDs have a greater volume so they use Linear PCM, which has a higher sampling rate - up to 24-bit at a sampling rate of 96 kHz.

pulsing_zombie
A form of DoS attack known as a degradation-of-service attack, as opposed to a denial-of-service attack. Unlike a regular zombie that paralyzes a system by inundating it with a steady stream of attack traffic, the pulsing zombie attacks with irregular small bursts of attack traffic from multiple sources on a single target over an extended period of time. Pulsing zombie attacks are more difficult to detect and trace because since they are slow and gradual they do not immediately appear as malicious.

punchdown_block
(n.) A device that connects one group of wires to another group of wires through a system of metal pegs that the wires are attached to, often used in telecommunications closets that support local-area networks. Punchdown blocks are the predecessors to patch panels and were commonly used to support low-bandwidth Ethernet and token-ring networks. Punchdown blocks typically are not capable of supporting Cat-5 cabling, which is the common cable used in modern Ethernet designs.
Also referred to as a cross-connect block, terminating block, or a connecting block.
Applications: telecommunications, Internet telephony, networking.

Like punctuation in human languages, punctuation in programming languages serves to separate words and phrases. But unlike human punctuation, which is often optional, computer punctuation is strictly required.   

Punycode
As defined by RFC 3492, Punycode is a simple and efficient transfer encoding syntax designed for use with Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA). It uniquely and reversibly transforms a Unicode string into an ASCII string. ASCII characters in the Unicode string are represented literally, and nonSCII characters are represented by ASCII characters that are allowed in host name labels (letters, digits, and hyphens). The RFC 3492 document defines a general algorithm called Bootstring that allows a string of basic code points to uniquely represent any string of code points drawn from a larger set. Punycode is an instance of Bootstring that uses particular parameter values specified by this document, appropriate for IDNA.

PUO
Short for User Operation Prohibitions UOP is a selection on a DVD that has been flagged to prevent certain user actions. For example, a FBI Warning on a DVD cannot be skipped or or fast-forwared by the viewer as a direct result of a UOP.

PUP
Acronym for potentially unwanted program
PUP or PUPs is a term used to describe unwanted  programs such as Trojans, spyware and adware, along with other malware which may compromise your privacy. Some antivirus and PC security software packages, like McAfee VirusScan, will scan for and protect your system against PUPs. The term PUP was first used by persons at McAfee's Avert research lab to avoid any legal issues that may arise from calling these types of applications "spyware".

puppy_linux
Puppy Linux is a lightweight Linux distribution designed to be easy to install and use. Puppy is small (the live-CD is less than 100MB) and loads completely into RAM, which also makes it fast. Puppy has very low system requirements making it a suitable open source operating system for older PCs and in netbooks. This open source operating system is bundled with a number of applications for general use including word processor, spreadsheet, Internet browser, games, image editor and other utilities. 
Puppy Linux was created by Barry Kauler who released version 0.1 in June 2003. Today, the Puppy-project is a team effort.

PureVideo
A trademark of NVIDIA Corporation, PureVideo technology is the combination of a high-definition video processing core on the NVIDIA GPU and software that is used to play ultra-smooth movies with minimal CPU use and low power consumption. NVIDIA PureVideo is supported in the following NVIDIA products; GeForce, GeForce M (formerly known as GeForce Go), and NVIDIA Quadro.

PureVideo_HD
A trademark of NVIDIA Corporation, PureVideo HD technology is a video processing architecture that enables the compatible NVIDIA GPU video processors to offload Blu-ray and HD DVD H.264 video decoding from the CPU. PureVideo HD technology is the combination of a dedicated video processing core on the NVIDIA GPU and software in the NVIDIA drivers. PureVideo HD technology is available in the NVIDIA GeForce Series 7 and 8 GPUs.

purge
To systematically and permanently remove old and unneeded data. The term purge is stronger than delete. It is often possible to regain deleted objects by undeleting them, but purged objects are gone forever. Also see Are Deleted Files Completely Erased? in the Did You Know . . . ? section of Webopedia.

PURL
Short for persistent URL, a type of URL that acts as an intermediary for a real URL of a Web resource. When you enter a PURL in a browser, the browser sends the page request to a PURL server which then returns the real URL of the page. PURLs are persistent because once a PURL is established, it never needs to change. The real address of the web page may change but the PURL remains the same.  PURLs are managed by the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC).    

push
(1) In client/server applications, to send data to a client without the client requesting it. The World Wide Web is based on a pull technology where the client browser must request a Web page before it is sent. Broadcast media, on the other hand, are push technologies because they send information out regardless of whether anyone is tuned in.  Increasingly, companies are using the Internet to deliver information push-style. Probably the oldest and most widely used push technology is e-mail. This is a push technology because you receive mail whether you ask for it or not -- that is, the sender pushes the message to the receiver.  (2) In programming, to place a data item onto a stack. The opposite of push is pop, which means to remove an object from a stack.    

push_strategy
A channel partner term that is used to describe how products and services move through channel partners to the consumer.  A push strategy uses marketing channels, such as trade promotions, to "push" a product or service through to the sales channel. Push strategy is one of several types of channel strategies.
Contrast with pull strategy.

push_button
A button in a dialog box. See under button. 

push_to_talk
Push-to-talk (or press-to-talk) is a two-way communication method that uses half-duplex mode where transmission occurs in both directions, but not at the same time. To use PTT, users must press a button on the PTT device while speaking, then release it when done. The listener must then do the same to respond. Common PTT devices include the walkie-talkie. Newer PTT systems use VoIP to provide digital PTT service over 3G data networks. Synonymous with press-to-talk. 
In PC and mobile voice chat applications, push-to-talk is a software feature that requires the speaker to press a button to enable voice speaking. This prevents background noises and talking from sending during the chat session.
Push-to-talk may be abbreviated as PTT or P2T.See also Push-to-talk Over Cellular.

Push_to_talk_Over_Cellular
Push-to-talk Over Cellular (POC) is the push to talk (PTT) voice service for mobile communications. It provides direct one-to-one and one-to-many voice communication service in the cellular network. It is based on half-duplex VoIP technology over mobile networks which allows PTT service to use cellular access resources. See also PTT.

PuTTY
A free Telnet and SSH terminal software for Windows and Unix platforms that enables users to remotely access computers over the Internet. PuTTY was written by Simon Tatham.

PVC
Short for permanent virtual circuit, a virtual circuit that is permanently available. The only difference between a PVC and a switched virtual circuit (SVC) is that an SVC must be reestablished each time data is to be sent. Once the data has been sent, the SVC disappears. PVCs are more efficient for connections between hosts that communicate frequently.  PVCs play a central role in Frame Relay networks. They're also supported in some other types of networks, such as X.25. 

PVP
Short for player versus player PVP is a type of video or computer games in which the in-game combat takes place between two human players (gamers) rather than a player and a computer controlled opponent. Also see  All About Multiplayer PC Gaming in Webopedia's "Did You Know...?" section.

PVS
Short for personal video recorder, PVR is a generic term for a device that is similar to a VCR but records television data in digital format as opposed to the VCR's analog format. VCRs utilize analog tapes to record and play programs broadcast over television, but PVRs encode video data in MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 formats and store the data in a hard drive. PVRs have all of the same functionality of VCRs (recording, playback, fast forwarding, rewinding, pausing) plus the ability to instantly jump to any part of the program without having to rewind or fast forward the data stream.
A PVR is essentially made up of two elements: the device that stores its hardware elements, such as the hard disk drive, power supply and buses, and the software in the form of a subscription service that provides programming information and the ability to encode the data streams.
Two common PVR systems are TiVo and ReplayTV.

pwoms
An acronym for Parent(s) Watching Over My Shoulder, PWOMS is commonly used in text messaging, SMS, instant messaging, chat rooms and other real time text-based communications, and is a warning sign that the sender's parents are nearby and others should watch what they type or say.
More Chat/ Text Acronyms Parents Need to Know
Similar acronyms that are sometimes used in place of PWOMS include POS or POTS (Parent Over the Shoulder), PLOS (Parents Looking Over Shoulder), PAW or P@W (Parents Are Watching), PAL (Parents Are Listening), PBM (Parent Behind Me) and PBB (Parent Behind Back).  Occasionally, numbers or codes like 9, 99, Code 9 or P911 (Parent Alert) are used to communicate similar messages.
PWOMS and POS are also sometimes followed by the words "on" or "off" to indicate when a parent has entered the room or left the room and can no longer watch over the person's shoulder.  Another related acronym is POF, which stands for Parents on Facebook.

PWS
(1) Short for personal Web server, a generic term for a Web server that is used to host Web page files for an individual.  (2) When capitalized as Personal Web Server, the name of Microsoft��s Web server program for individuals hosting Web page files from a personal computer. Personal Web Server is a smaller-scale version of Microsoft��s IIS technology and is therefore limited in its capabilities. It is designed to support Web sites that obtain limited traffic and/or to be used as a staging server for building pages that will be transferred to a server that can handle large amounts of traffic.

PXE
Short for Pre-Boot Execution Environment. Pronounced pixie, PXE is one of the components of Intel's WfM specification. It allows a workstation to boot from a server on a network prior to booting the operating system on the local hard drive. A PXE-enabled workstation connects its NIC to the LAN via a jumper, which keeps the workstation connected to the network even when the power is off. Because a network administrator does not have to physically visit the specific workstation and manually boot it, operating systems and other software, such as diagnostic programs, can be loaded onto the device from a server over the network.
PXE is a mandatory element of the WfM specification. To be considered compliant, the PXE must be supported by the computer's BIOS and its NIC.

Python
An interpreted, object-oriented programming language developed by Guido van Rossum. The name comes from one of van Rossum's favorite television shows, Monty Python's Flying Circus. Python is very portable since Python interpreters are available for most operating system platforms. Although Python is copyrighted, the source code is open source, and unlike GNU software, it can be commercially re-sold.
